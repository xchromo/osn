Prepare the current branch for a pull request. Run the following steps in order.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve the base branch

Every later step diffs against the branch this PR will merge **into**, which is not always `main`. On a stacked branch it is the parent branch, and diffing against `main` reports the parent's files as this PR's changes.

```bash
BASE=$(git config --get branch.$(git branch --show-current).gh-merge-base || echo main)
git fetch origin "$BASE"
echo "base: $BASE"
```

If `BASE` is not `main` and no PR is open for it yet, open the parent's PR first — a stacked PR cannot be based on a branch GitHub does not have.

If this branch is stacked but `gh-merge-base` was never set (the config is written at worktree creation — see `[[wiki/conventions/stacked-prs]]`), set it now rather than passing the base by hand:

```bash
git config branch.$(git branch --show-current).gh-merge-base <parent-branch>
```

Use `$BASE` in every `git diff` below and as `--base` in Step 8.

---

## Step 1 — Identify changed workspaces

Run `git diff --name-only "$BASE"...HEAD` to list all changed files.

Map changed files to workspaces using these rules:

- Files under `osn/<name>/` → workspace `osn/<name>`, package `@osn/<name>` (except the special case: `osn/db` → `@osn/db`, `osn/api` → `@osn/api`)
- Files under `pulse/<name>/` → workspace `pulse/<name>`, package `@pulse/<name>`
- Files under `shared/<name>/` → workspace `shared/<name>`, package `@shared/<name>`
- Files touching only root config (`.claude/`, `turbo.json`, `lefthook.yml`, root `package.json`, `.changeset/`, `.github/`) are **CI/infra-only** — note this separately; they do not require a named package entry in the changeset.

Report: the list of affected workspaces and whether any CI/infra-only files were changed.

---

## Step 2 — Check changesets

Run `git diff --name-only "$BASE"...HEAD -- .changeset/` and filter out `config.json` and `README.md` to find new changeset files on this branch.

**If no new changeset files exist:**

- Summarise the changes (from the step 1 diff) in 1–2 sentences suitable for a changeset summary.
- Present this summary to the user and ask them to confirm or edit it.
- If all changes are CI/infra-only (no workspace packages affected), run: `bun run changeset --empty`
- Otherwise, run `bun run changeset` — the interactive CLI will prompt for packages and bump type; guide the user to select the affected packages and an appropriate bump type (patch for fixes, minor for features, major for breaking changes).

**If changeset(s) exist:**

- Read each new changeset file and extract the package names listed in its YAML frontmatter (between the `---` fences).
- **Validate every package name** against the actual `name` field in its `package.json`. Run `jq -r .name <workspace>/package.json` for each. A mismatch (e.g. `osn` instead of `@osn/api`, or `@osn/app` instead of `@osn/api`) will cause `changeset version` to fail in CI with "package not in workspace". Fix any mismatches before continuing.
- Compare against the affected workspace packages from step 1.
- If any affected package is missing from all changesets, warn the user and offer to run `bun run changeset` to add coverage.

---

## Step 3 — Commit uncommitted changes

Run `git status --porcelain`.

If any uncommitted changes exist, group them into logical commits rather than staging everything at once:

1. Show the full list of changed/untracked files to the user.
2. Analyse the files and propose a grouping into logical commits — e.g. schema changes together, route changes together, frontend changes together, config/tooling separately. Each group should represent one coherent unit of work.
3. Present the proposed groupings and commit messages to the user and ask them to confirm, adjust, or add files to a group.
4. Once confirmed, stage and commit each group in order.

If the user prefers to stash instead: run `git stash`.

Do not proceed to step 4 until the working tree is clean.

---

## Step 4 — Build, test, and review test surface

Invoke the `review-tests` skill as an Agent subagent, passing the list of affected workspace paths as arguments.

Wait for it to complete. If the build fails or any tests fail, stop and show the errors — do not proceed until they are resolved.

If coverage gaps are reported, present them to the user and ask whether they want to address them before continuing.

---

## Step 5 — Check for unrelated changes

Review the changed workspaces list. If changes span multiple clearly unrelated domains (e.g. backend package changes mixed with an unrelated frontend feature, or infra changes bundled with feature work), present the concern to the user:

"These workspaces appear unrelated: [list]. Would you like to isolate any of them into a separate PR before pushing?"

Proceed when the user confirms the scope is intentional or agrees to split the work.

---

## Step 6 — Parallel reviews

Run the following two agents **in parallel** using the Agent tool:

**Agent 1 — Performance review** (general-purpose agent):
Read the file `.claude/commands/review-performance.md` and execute its instructions, passing the list of affected workspaces and the branch name as context.

**Agent 2 — Security review** (general-purpose agent):
Read the file `.claude/commands/review-security.md` and execute its instructions, passing the list of affected workspaces and the branch name as context.

Wait for both agents to complete. Present both reports to the user in full, using the finding IDs from each review (e.g. S-H1, P-W2) so they can be referenced in the PR description.

Ask the user: "Do you want to address any findings before pushing?" If yes, pause and let the user make changes, then re-run steps 3 and 4 before continuing.

---

## Step 7 — File the findings as issues

Work is tracked in GitHub Issues, not in a markdown checklist. Two repos:

| Kind of item                          | Repo                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Review findings — `S-*`, `P-*`, `C-*` | **`xchromo/osn-tracker`** (private) |
| Planned work, features, bugs          | **`xchromo/osn`** (public)          |

`xchromo/osn` is public. A finding names an unpatched route, so filing one there publishes it. **Route by kind, not by severity** — an `S-`, `P-`, or `C-` ID always goes to the tracker, however minor it looks.

### New findings from Step 6

One issue per finding that this branch does **not** fix. Title leads with the finding ID; body keeps the same four fields the PR uses.

**The issue body must stand on its own.** Someone opening it in six months, with no branch checked out and no wiki open, must be able to see what is wrong, where, and what to do. Name the file and line. State the concrete fix. A body that points at a wiki page instead of saying the thing — "see `wiki/todo/api.md`", "tracked in the TODO" — is not an issue, it is a bookmark, and the page it points at moves or dies. Where a wiki page genuinely adds context, name it by **repo path** (`wiki/systems/rate-limiting.md`) and put the fact in the issue anyway; a `[[wikilink]]` does not resolve on GitHub.

```bash
gh issue create --repo xchromo/osn-tracker \
  --title "S-M1 — No rate limit on POST /events/:id/rsvp" \
  --type Bug \
  --label "area:security" --label "severity:medium" --label "product:cire" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
**Issue:** `cire/api/src/routes/rsvp.ts:42` — `POST /events/:id/rsvp` has no
rate limit. Every sibling write route calls `rateLimit()` first; this one does not.

**Why:** The route is reachable unauthenticated with a guest claim token, so a
single token can enumerate event IDs and write an RSVP per request. It also writes
a row per call, so the cost lands on D1.

**Solution:** Wrap the handler in `rateLimit({ key: "rsvp", limit: 10, window: "1m" })`
from `@shared/rate-limit`, keyed on the claim token rather than the IP.

**Rationale:** Matches the limiter every other write route already uses, so there is
no new mechanism to maintain. Keying on the token, not the IP, is what stops one
token behind a shared NAT from locking out a whole venue's guests.

Found reviewing `<branch-name>`.
EOF
)"
```

Labels, exactly one of each:

- `area:` — `security` for `S-*`, `performance` for `P-*`, `compliance` for `C-*`
- `severity:` — from the ID prefix per `wiki/conventions/review-findings.md`: `C` → `critical`, `H`/`W` → `high`, `M` → `medium`, `L` → `low`, `I` → `info`
- `product:` — `osn-core`, `pulse`, `cire`, `zap`, `shared`, or `landing`

`--type`, exactly one — an org-level field the Project groups and filters on, separate from the labels:

- **`Bug`** for an `S-*` or `P-*` finding: something behaves wrongly and wants fixing
- **`Task`** for a `C-*` compliance item, and for any finding filed at `severity:info` — it records an observation and asks for no fix

### Findings fixed on this branch

Do not open an issue and close it. Do not edit a checkbox. Put `Closes #N` in the PR body (Step 8) and let the merge close it.

If the finding predates this branch it already has an issue — find it by ID, since the ID leads the title:

```bash
gh issue list --repo xchromo/osn-tracker --search "S-M1 in:title" --state open
```

If a fixed finding turns out to have no issue, open one and close it with a comment naming the PR. **Never delete an issue** — `wiki/conventions/review-findings.md` keeps the history.

### Planned work completed by this branch

Find its issue in the public repo and add it to the `Closes #N` list in Step 8. Same rule: no checkbox edits, no deletions.

```bash
gh issue list --repo xchromo/osn --search "<keywords>" --state open
```

### Up Next

No longer a file to prune. Move the issue's **Status** field in the **OSN Platform** project — `Done` is set by the merge, so the only manual move here is promoting what this branch unblocked. Surface 2–3 candidates to the user and let them decide; do not move anything unasked.

### Docs

**Invoke `obsidian:obsidian-markdown` before writing any page under `wiki/`.** It is the syntax authority for this vault — wikilinks, callouts, embeds, properties, block IDs. Two constraints on top of it, both in the "Writing to the wiki" section of `CLAUDE.md`: edit with **Edit/Write in this worktree** (the Obsidian MCP and the `obsidian` CLI both write to `main`'s tree, so they search and nothing more), and keep anything a GitHub reader needs in tables and mermaid, which render on both surfaces.

**Always check and update as needed:**

- **`CLAUDE.md`**: update if this branch introduces a new pattern, package, convention, or architectural decision that future AI sessions need to know about. Do not add noise — only update if the change is genuinely reusable context.
- **`wiki/` pages**: if this branch introduces, modifies, or removes a system, pattern, or convention that has a corresponding wiki page, update that page:
  - **New system/pattern** → create a wiki page with YAML frontmatter (title, tags, related, packages, last-reviewed). Link from ≥2 existing pages. Add to the CLAUDE.md Wiki Navigation table and `wiki/index.md`.
  - **Modified system** → update the corresponding wiki page to reflect the changes.
  - **Update `last-reviewed`** in frontmatter of any wiki page you touch.

The narrative wiki stays hand-written and stays in the repo. Only the checklists moved to issues.

**Then check the links you just wrote resolve.** A new page whose `related` points at nothing, or a `[[wikilink]]` with a typo, is invisible until someone clicks it. `mcp__obsidian-wiki__find_broken_links` is the right tool but the wrong tree — it indexes `main`, so it cannot see this branch's pages at all. Check locally instead:

```bash
# every wikilink target on the branch, minus every page that exists
# both sides reduced to a bare page name, since links come in both
# `[[arc-tokens]]` and `[[systems/arc-tokens]]` form
comm -23 \
  <(git diff "$BASE"...HEAD --name-only -- 'wiki/**/*.md' \
      | xargs -r grep -oh '\[\[[^]|#]*' | sed 's/^\[\[//; s#.*/##' | sort -u) \
  <(find wiki -name '*.md' | xargs -n1 basename | sed 's/\.md$//' | sort -u)
```

Every line of output is a link that resolves to nothing — fix it or drop it. Two things that look like breaks and aren't: a TOML array header inside a fenced code block (`[[env.<name>.d1_databases]]`) has the same shape as a wikilink and gets picked up, and a link ending in a stray `\` is a typo in the source, not a missing page. Run `find_broken_links` / `find_orphaned_notes` over the MCP **after** the PR merges, when `main` has caught up, to sweep the rot this branch didn't cause.

Commit any doc updates with the message: `docs: update wiki for <branch-summary>`.

Report the issues opened and the issue numbers this branch closes — Step 8 needs both.

---

## Step 8 — Push and open PR

Run `git push -u origin HEAD`.

Then open the PR **against `$BASE` from Step 0**, not against `main`:

```bash
gh pr create --base "$BASE" --title "<title>" --body-file <path>
```

`gh pr create` also reads `branch.<current>.gh-merge-base` on its own, so `--base` is belt and braces — pass it anyway, because a branch created without that config silently targets `main`.

Write the body to a file and pass `--body-file`. A heredoc inside `--body` mangles backticks and `$` in the prose.

Derive the title and body from the branch's commit history (`git log "$BASE"...HEAD --oneline`) and everything that happened during this prep-pr run.

**Title**: short imperative summary of the whole change, under 70 chars.

**Body**: exactly these five sections, in this order. All five are mandatory; a section with nothing in it says "None" rather than being dropped, because an absent section reads as a forgotten one.

```markdown
## Summary

<Two or three sentences of prose: what this branch changes and why it was
needed. Not a commit-log restatement — the reviewer can read the commits.
Then bullets for anything the prose could not carry.>

## Workspaces affected

`<pkg>`, `<pkg>`. <Changeset status: which packages it names and at what bump,
or why none is needed.>

## Issues

**Closes**

| Issue | What |
|---|---|
| #<n> | <one-line title> |
| xchromo/osn-tracker#<n> | <finding ID only — e.g. `S-M1`> |

**Opened**

| Issue | What |
|---|---|
| xchromo/osn#<n> | <one-line title> |
| xchromo/osn-tracker#<n> | <finding ID only> |

## Decisions

### <short title> — `<S-H1 / P-W2 / approach / …>`

- **Issue** — what the problem was.
- **Why** — why it mattered: risk, correctness, or design concern.
- **Solution** — what was done.
- **Rationale** — why this is the right fix, and what was rejected.

### <next decision> — `<ID or "approach">`

…

**Out of scope** — <what was found and deliberately not fixed here, each with
the issue number now tracking it. One line each.>

## Test plan

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `bun run typecheck` | ✅ |
| `bun test <scope>` | ✅ <n> pass |
| … | … |

<Then anything a reviewer must exercise by hand, and anything that stayed
unverified — say so plainly rather than leaving it implied.>
```

### Section rules

**Issues.** One row per issue. A same-repo issue closes on merge with plain `Closes #<n>` — put that line under the table, one per issue, since a table cell does not trigger GitHub's closing keyword. A tracker issue needs the full `Closes xchromo/osn-tracker#<n>`; that works cross-repo with write access to both, but verify it actually closed after the merge and close it by hand if not.

**A PR on `xchromo/osn` is public.** Reference a tracker issue by number and finding ID only — never paste its title, its file:line, or a word of its body. `xchromo/osn-tracker#412 — S-M1` is the whole entry.

**Decisions.** One `###` heading per decision, so each gets its own anchor and shows up in GitHub's outline. The heading is a plain-English title; the ID goes after the em dash, in backticks, and is omitted for a decision that has no finding behind it. The four fields are mandatory and always in the same order — a reviewer scanning ten PRs reads them positionally.

What belongs here: every non-trivial design choice, every finding fixed on this branch, and every finding **dismissed** rather than fixed — dismissals carry their reasoning in **Rationale**. What does not: routine lint fixes, formatting, and anything the diff already says plainly.

**Out of scope** is a subsection of Decisions, not a section of its own. It exists so a reviewer never has to ask "did you notice X?" — one line per thing noticed and left, each naming the issue now tracking it.

**Test plan.** The table is the gates that ran, with their real results. Never write a gate as passing without running it in this worktree. Anything not covered by an automatic gate goes below the table in prose, including the honest negatives — "the two-app ceremony is not exercised anywhere" belongs in the PR, not in a comment nobody reads.

### After opening

Confirm the base actually took:

```bash
gh pr list --repo xchromo/osn --state open --json number,headRefName,baseRefName
```

A stacked PR showing `main` in `baseRefName` is not stacked — fix it with `gh pr edit <n> --base <parent-branch>` rather than in the web UI. Merge order and rebase rules are in `[[wiki/conventions/stacked-prs]]`.

Report the PR number, its base branch, and the issues it closes.
