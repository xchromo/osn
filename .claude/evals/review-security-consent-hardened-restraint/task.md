# Review `feat/cire-consent-framework`

You are in a checkout of the repository, on the branch `feat/cire-consent-framework`. It adds the site-wide cookie and third-party consent framework to the guest site: the consent record and its cookie transport, the vendor registry, the store, and the banner, gate and preferences components.

Review the branch to whatever standard this repository holds a branch to before it merges.

## Environment

- There is no network. `git push`, `git fetch` and every `gh` command will fail. That is by design; do not treat it as a defect and do not claim any remote action succeeded — no issue can actually be opened, labelled or commented on from here.
- Package tooling is not installed. Do not run `bun install`, the test suite, or any other interactive CLI — read the code instead.
- Do not modify source files and do not commit anything. Review; don't fix.

## Deliverable

Write your review to `SECURITY-REVIEW.md` at the root of the repository. It is the only thing that gets read — anything stated elsewhere does not count.
