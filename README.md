# Open Social Network (OSN)

An open, modular social platform. Users own their identity and their social graph, and decide which apps get to see them.

## Vision

OSN splits the social graph away from the apps that use it. You own your identity and your relationships. You opt into apps one at a time, and your access rules follow you across all of them. Block someone on OSN and the block reaches every app you have connected — unless you say otherwise.

## Core Principles

- **Modular**: each capability (events, messaging, weddings, social media) is a standalone app. Use what you want, ignore the rest.
- **Transparent data**: you can read every piece of personalisation data we hold on you, and wipe it whenever you like.
- **Private by design**: E2E encryption for messaging (Signal Protocol), fine-grained visibility rules, hidden-attendance options.
- **Open standards**: OSN is an OIDC issuer, so third parties can build on it. Self-hosting is planned for enterprise use.

## Status

Phase 1. Three surfaces run in production on Cloudflare; the rest run locally.

| Surface | Packages | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| Identity / auth API | `@osn/api` | Live — Worker on `id.cireweddings.com` |
| Wedding invites (Cire) | `@cire/api`, `@cire/web`, `@cire/organiser`, `@cire/vendor`, `@cire/db`, `@cire/theme` | Live — `cireweddings.com` zone |
| Wedding marketing site | `@cire/landing` | Live — apex `cireweddings.com` |
| Identity & graph UI | `@osn/social` | Local only |
| Events (Pulse) | `@pulse/app`, `@pulse/api`, `@pulse/db` | Local only |
| Messaging (Zap) | `@zap/api`, `@zap/db` | Worker on `zap.cireweddings.com` — M1 in flight, client app not started |
| OSN / Pulse marketing sites | `@osn/landing`, `@pulse/landing` | Built, not yet deployed |

CI deploys the `osn-api`, `cire-api` and `zap-api` Workers, the guest site (Worker SSR) and the organiser, vendor and landing sites (Pages) on merge to `main`. D1 migrations apply automatically. See `wiki/runbooks/production-deploy.md`.

## Applications

### OSN Core

The identity and social-graph layer. It is the OIDC issuer the other apps authenticate against.

- Passkeys are the only primary login (WebAuthn / FIDO2). OTP survives as a step-up factor; magic links and PKCE primary flows are gone
- Server-side session store with rotation and reuse detection (Copenhagen Book C1/C2/C3)
- Short-lived ES256 access tokens (5-minute TTL, `aud: "osn-access"`), public keys at `/.well-known/jwks.json`. Downstream services verify through `@shared/osn-auth-client`
- Per-device session list, "sign out everywhere else", per-passkey rename and delete
- Recovery codes for a lost device (Copenhagen Book M2)
- Step-up "sudo" tokens for sensitive actions — recovery-code generation, email change, passkey delete
- Cross-device login by QR code
- Social graph: connections, close friends, blocked users
- Many profiles per account (one login, several public handles)
- Friends-of-friends recommendations
- Organisations, with ARC service-to-service tokens for internal calls

### Cire (Wedding invites)

A bespoke digital wedding invite: a tactile, animated guest site plus a portal where the couple runs the guest list. It began as its own repo and moved in as a sibling workspace. The schema is already multi-tenant (a `weddings` root table), so it can become a product without a rewrite.

- Guest site — claim code unlocks the invite, then events, details and RSVP
- Organiser portal — guest and event tables, spreadsheet import, per-section invite theming, co-hosts added by OSN handle
- Vendor portal — vendor profiles and couple enquiries
- Two auth models that never overlap: guests exchange a family claim code for a hashed session cookie and never need an OSN account; organisers sign in with their OSN passkey and are checked against wedding ownership
- Optional account linking lets a guest attach their seat to an OSN account

Detail lives in `wiki/apps/cire.md` and `wiki/systems/cire-auth.md`.

### Pulse (Events)

A unified events platform: the social ease of Facebook Events, the fun of Partiful and Luma, the tooling of Eventbrite.

- Discovery by location, category, date, friends attending, interests
- Default view: what's happening today near you
- Event lifecycle: Not Started → Started (configurable ticket cutoff) → Ongoing → Finished
- Recurring events as a parent series with child instances
- Organiser tools: moderation, cross-event blacklists, ticket setup
- Venue pages — a nightclub with its DJ schedule, genres and nightly events
- Event group chats, served by the messaging backend
- Calendar view with iCal export (one-way sync to Google and Apple Calendar)
- Hidden attendance for private events
- Share-source attribution — which channel brought each RSVP in

### Zap (Messaging)

Secure, playful messaging that doubles as the ecosystem's support and announcements channel. It should sit between Messenger, Instagram and iMessage — playful but not loud, modern, secure, open.

**Two top-level views:**

1. **Socials** — DMs, group chats, organisation chats; filterable.
2. **AI** — conversations with AI models, kept out of the normal inbox.

**Core features:**

- DMs and group chats
- Disappearing messages, per chat
- Themes, stickers, GIFs, polls, easter-egg mini-games
- E2E encryption via Signal Protocol (`@shared/crypto`, planned)
- Event group chats reachable from both Pulse and Zap, with the event overview in chat settings
- Backups: encrypted cloud, self-hosted cloud, or local only
- Device transfer

**Key differentiator — organisation chats:**

- **Verified organisations** — blue-tick verification for businesses, public bodies and NGOs.
- **Support over a Zap handle** — a business replaces `support@acme.com` with `@acme`. Phishing gets harder because the verified handle is the only source of truth.
- **Embeddable web widget** — a third-party site swaps its email-capture support form for "Enter your OSN handle". The thread lands in Zap under the verified organisation with full history. Checkouts can capture a handle next to (or instead of) an email to smooth post-purchase support.
- **Organisation tooling** — dashboards for triage, agent assignment, analytics, SLA monitoring and audit.
- **Locality and government channels** — users opt into a locality (home city, plus a temporary one while travelling) and get official notices — floods, evacuations, public safety. AI-assisted queries route people to authoritative answers ("where is the nearest relief centre?") in real time.

`@zap/api` and `@zap/db` are scaffolded (M0 done, M1 in flight). `@zap/app`, the Tauri + SolidJS client, has not started. See `wiki/TODO.md` and `wiki/apps/zap.md`.

### Social media (spec only, deferred)

Multi-format social content with per-format opt-out: text posts, image posts, long-form writing, short-form video. A user who wants nothing to do with short video can switch that format off entirely.

## Architecture

### Monorepo structure

Organised by domain. Five top-level directories, one workspace prefix each.

  email/             # EmailService Tag — Resend / Cloudflare / Log / Noop transports
  feature-flags/     # Key-optional, fail-safe flag client (GrowthBook)
  observability/     # OpenTelemetry helpers, Elysia plugin, instrumentedFetch
  osn-auth-client/   # Downstream access-JWT verification — JWKS cache, Elysia adapter
  rate-limit/        # Per-IP / per-user limiter primitives, client-IP trust policy
  redis/             # Redis wrapper, rate-limiter Lua, JTI / rotated-session stores
  turnstile/         # Key-optional, fail-closed Turnstile verifier
  typescript-config/ # base / node / solid tsconfigs
```

Each Tauri app keeps the standard layout: `src/` for the SolidJS frontend, `src-tauri/` for the Rust layer with iOS and Android targets.

**Prefix rule:** every workspace sits under exactly one of `osn/`, `pulse/`, `zap/`, `cire/` or `shared/`, and its `package.json` `name` uses the matching prefix.

Dependencies flow one way: `shared/*` depends on nothing internal; `osn/*` depends on `shared/*`; `pulse/*`, `zap/*` and `cire/*` may depend on `osn/*` and `shared/*` but never on each other. Cross-domain reads go through a bridge module — Pulse reaches the social graph through `graphBridge`, Cire through ARC-gated internal endpoints.

### Backend

- **Elysia** on Bun locally, on Cloudflare Workers in production. Workers builds run with `aot: false` — Elysia's ahead-of-time compilation uses `new Function`, which workerd forbids
- **Effect.ts** for services. The layer graph is built once at boot as a shared `ManagedRuntime`, never per request
- **Eden treaty** for type-safe internal calls; plain REST for third-party consumers
- **ARC tokens** — self-issued ES256 JWTs with `kid`, scope and audience — for service-to-service auth
- **WebSockets** for live messaging and event updates (planned)
- **Rate limiting** on auth, graph and org writes. Fail-closed. Native Workers rate-limit bindings for the 60-second windows, Upstash Redis for the rest
- **Turnstile** bot protection on register, login, claim and RSVP. Key-optional: no secret means the check is inert

### Databases

Four environments, two drivers, one Drizzle type:

| Environment | Driver | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | bun:sqlite | Dev machine — `bun run dev` and in-memory tests |
| `dev` | Cloudflare D1 | `wrangler dev --env dev` (miniflare) or deployed |
| `staging` | Cloudflare D1 | Deployed |
| `production` | Cloudflare D1 | Deployed |

`@shared/db-utils` broadens the Drizzle handle over both the sync (bun:sqlite) and async (D1) result kinds, so the same query code runs everywhere — service code must `await`. See `wiki/systems/database-environments.md`.

### Frontend

- **Standalone apps first**, working toward a hybrid super-app
- **iOS first**, then web, then Android (Android deferred)
- **SolidJS** everywhere; **Astro + Solid** for the web surfaces and marketing sites
- **Tauri** for native builds
- Shared components in `@osn/ui`, built on Kobalte in the Zaidan (shadcn-for-Solid) style

### Messaging architecture

`@zap/api` is the shared messaging backend, in two modes:

- **Direct** — the user has opted into Zap
- **Indirect** — the user only touches messaging through another app, e.g. a Pulse event chat

So Pulse users can join event chats without installing Zap.

## Getting Started

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh) — the pinned version is in `.bun-version`.

```bash
bun install              # install every workspace
bun run dev              # start everything (turbo)
```

Most of the time you want one stack, not all of them:

```bash
bun run dev:osn          # identity API
bun run dev:social       # identity API + social app
bun run dev:pulse        # pulse API + app, identity API, zap API
bun run dev:zap          # zap API + identity API
bun run dev:cire         # cire API + guest + organiser, identity API
bun run dev:apis         # backends only
```

Packages that need configuration ship a `.env.example` — copy it to `.env` and fill it in. Everything degrades without secrets: no Resend key logs emails instead of sending them, no Turnstile secret leaves the bot check inert.

Checks:

```bash
bun run check            # type-check
bun run test             # all tests
bun run lint             # oxlint
bun run fmt              # oxfmt
```

Database work runs from the owning package:

```bash
bun run --cwd cire/db db:migrate    # generate migrations
bun run --cwd pulse/db db:studio    # Drizzle Studio
bun run db:reset                    # reset every local database
```

`CLAUDE.md` holds the full command list and the code conventions.

## Data Models (conceptual)

### Account and profile

- Identity (OIDC subject), passkeys, sessions, recovery codes
- One account, many profiles — each with its own public handle
- Interests and personalisation data, readable and resettable by the user

### Social graph

- Connections (mutual follow / friend)
- Close friends
- Blocks, OSN-wide or per app
- App authorisations

### Event

- Basics: title, description, location, date and time
- Lifecycle state, moved automatically by the clock
- Configuration: late joins, ticket limits
- Parent series reference, for recurring events
- Associated chat
- Organiser, attendees, category, tags

### Event series

- Recurrence pattern
- Child event instances

### Message / chat

- E2E encrypted content
- Type: DM, group, or event-linked
- Participants, and an event reference for event chats

### Wedding

- Wedding root, owner profile, co-hosts
- Families with claim codes, and the guests inside them
- Events, sections and per-section theming
- RSVPs, dietary notes, vendor enquiries

## Moderation

- **User reporting** across every app
- **Community notes** — collaborative context, Twitter-style
- **Organiser controls** for event spaces
- **Organisation blacklists** spanning many events

## Contributing

Every change goes through a pull request. Nobody pushes to `main`.

Work on a feature branch, and include a changeset describing the change and the packages it touches:

```bash
bun run changeset
```

Pick the packages, pick the bump type, write a summary. The CI "Changeset Check" job fails without one. Two rules it enforces: package names must match the workspace `name` exactly (`"@pulse/app"`, not `"pulse"`), and a single changeset must not mix version-less packages (`@cire/*`) with versioned ones.

On merge, CI runs `changeset version` to bump versions and update changelogs, commits that to `main`, and deploys the live surfaces.
