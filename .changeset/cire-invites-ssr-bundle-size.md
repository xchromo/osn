Cut the guest site's server bundle from 470 KB to 290 KB gzip, and stop
deploying its tests as live routes.

Tracker #287: `dist/server` (the SSR Cloudflare Worker) had grown to 470 KB
gzip from two unrelated mistakes.

`motion` was the first. Three `.motion.ts` modules — `Modal.motion.ts`, and
each design pack's `UnlockReveal.motion.ts` — only ever call it from a
client-side `onMount` prefetch hint or a DOM event handler, but Vite's SSR
build still walks and bundles every module reachable via `import()`. The whole
library shipped server-side with nothing there ever calling it. A Vite plugin
in `astro.config.mjs` now stubs the `motion` specifier out of the SSR module
graph only; the client build is untouched, so both design packs animate exactly
as before.

The three drift-guard tests were the second, and the larger one. Astro routes
every file under `src/pages`, so `index.test.ts`, `legal-pages.test.ts` and
`[slug]/registry.test.ts` were built and deployed: `/index.test` and
`/legal-pages.test` answered as real routes on the guest site, and the vitest
they import was a 534 KB (119 KB gzip) chunk in the Worker — 28% of the bundle.
Each is now `_`-prefixed, which is what excludes a file from Astro's router.
They stay beside the `.astro` file they read and vitest still collects them.

Both deploy jobs gained a step that measures the same total on every build and
fails if it passes 330 KB, so a regression on either scale is caught at the
deploy rather than in a size audit months later.
