Add social graph data model: connections, close friends, blocks.

`@osn/db` — three new Drizzle tables: `connections` (pending/accepted requests), `close_friends` (unidirectional inner circle), `blocks` (unidirectional mutes/blocks). Exported inferred types for each.

`@osn/core` — new `createGraphService` (Effect.ts, all graph operations) and `createGraphRoutes` (JWT-authenticated Elysia routes). Endpoints under `/graph/connections`, `/graph/close-friends`, `/graph/blocks`.
