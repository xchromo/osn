Clear six new high advisories and refresh a lockfile that had drifted behind its own ranges.

`fast-uri` 3.1.5 → 3.1.7. Four high advisories against 3.1.5 landed on 2026-09-02 (GHSA-5jgf-p345-68v8, GHSA-f65p-4m7j-42xc, GHSA-fph4-wmhf-6fwf, GHSA-jqff-g426-hqxp — two SSRF, two host confusion) and the pre-push `bun audit` gate went red. Taking 3.1.6, which is what those four advisories name as fixed, would have left two more: 3.1.7 also fixes GHSA-qw65-cvwx-89v3 (authority injection via an unvalidated port in `serialize()`) and GHSA-58mr-gqgx-xq4g (host confusion via unbalanced IP-literal brackets), neither of which is in the public advisory database yet, so no audit tool reports them. Reachability is the Astro language server only — `ajv` appears once in the lockfile, under `@astrojs/check`, and no deployed Worker or shipped bundle contains it. `smol-toml` 1.6.1 → 1.8.0 is the same shape: 1.7.1 carries the fix for GHSA-7w5x-hrqm-74c2, also absent from the database.

The rest is lockfile lag. The dependency sweep in this stack raised every declared range, but `bun.lock` stayed behind versions those ranges already admitted: `esbuild` 0.28.2, `postcss` 8.5.26, `picomatch` 4.0.7, `sharp` 0.35.4 (libvips 1.3.3), `js-yaml` 4.3.2, `ws` 8.21.3, `devalue` 5.9.2, `happy-dom` 20.12.2, `@cloudflare/workers-types` 5.20260903.1. Two are worth knowing about rather than just taking: `ws` 8.21.1 **lowers the `maxBufferedChunks` and `maxFragments` defaults** and counts empty fragments toward the limit, which is a behaviour change inside a patch and touches Zap's WebSocket surface; `picomatch` 4.0.5–4.0.7 are all matching-semantics fixes, so glob-driven config can shift.

`astro` 7.2.9 → 7.2.10 is the one with deployed consequences. It fixes an SSR manifest placeholder not being replaced when the server build is minified, which caused a runtime `Invalid URL` crash at server boot. It is pinned to 7.2.10 rather than left to float: 7.3.0 and 7.3.1 clear the three-day soak but not the fourteen-day rule for a minor, so they wait.

Two overrides were correcting themselves in the wrong direction and are fixed here. `undici` was pinned `^7.29.0` while `jsdom` 30 declares `undici ^8.9.0` and `unifont` 0.7.5 declares `^8.0.0` — a floor being used as a ceiling, holding both consumers a whole major below what they were written for and cutting the tree off from undici 8 security fixes. Raised to `^8.9.0` (resolves 8.10.1). Because top-level `miniflare` 4 pins undici at exactly 7.28.0 and the wrangler-nested miniflare 5 alpha pins 7.29.0, this was verified rather than assumed: type check, the full test suite, the Miniflare D1 tier, all four Worker builds, and a real `wrangler dev --local` boot of `osn-api` on workerd, which serves 200 on `/health`, `/.well-known/jwks.json` and `/` with no errors. `postcss` and `picomatch` were likewise below what `vite` 8.2.2 asks for (`^8.5.26` and `^4.0.5`), a floor gap opened by raising vite earlier in this stack.

Also: the `protobufjs` override matched nothing in the lockfile and is removed, and `bunfig.toml`'s note on the removed `fast-uri` soak exclusion claimed the package "parses URIs on the request path via ajv", which is not true of this tree and would have mispriced exactly the decision this changeset had to make.

One source change, in `cire/api/tests/index.test.ts`: `@cloudflare/workers-types` 5.20260903.1 makes `recordException` a required member of `Span`, so the test's `StubSpan` gains it, typed off the interface rather than restated so the next daily types release cannot drift it.
