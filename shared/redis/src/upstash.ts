/**
 * Upstash REST-backed `RedisClient` implementation.
 *
 * `@upstash/redis` speaks the Upstash HTTP/REST API via `fetch`, so it runs on
 * Cloudflare Workers (workerd) where ioredis's raw TCP sockets cannot. This
 * module is the Workers-path counterpart to `./ioredis` and carries no static
 * `ioredis` import, so the top-level `@shared/redis` entry stays Workers-safe.
 *
 * Mapping decisions (see the `RedisClient` contract in `./client`):
 * - `eval(script, keys, args)` → `toRedisReply(await redis.eval(script, keys,
 *   args))`. The SDK types `eval`'s result as whatever the caller claims, but
 *   it is really an HTTP response body nobody has checked — `toRedisReply`
 *   narrows it to the RESP value space at this boundary, the same as the
 *   ioredis path does in `./ioredis`.
 * - `get(key)` → `toRedisString(await redis.get(key), "GET")`. The client MUST
 *   be constructed with `automaticDeserialization: false` so values come back
 *   as raw strings — matching ioredis and the rotated-session-store, which
 *   round-trips opaque `familyId` strings and would break if Upstash
 *   JSON-parsed them. `get`'s own type is generic (`get<TData>`), the same
 *   unchecked-claim shape as `eval`, so the reply is narrowed at this
 *   boundary rather than trusted from the SDK's type.
 * - `set(key, value, pxMs?)` → `redis.set(key, value, { px })`.
 * - `del(...keys)` → `toRedisInteger(await redis.del(...keys), "DEL")`.
 * - `ping()` → `toRedisString(await redis.ping(), "PING") ?? ""`. PING never
 *   actually replies nil, but the fallback keeps the return type `string`
 *   rather than `string | null` for a case that cannot occur.
 * - `quit()` → no-op: the REST transport is stateless, there is no socket to
 *   close.

 *
 * The SDK types most of these as generic in their result (`get<TData>`,
 * `eval<TArgs, TData = unknown>`), i.e. it will hand back whatever the caller
 * claims. The claims are made once, here, and each is justified: `eval` keeps
 * the SDK's own `TData = unknown` default rather than pinning a type — it is
 * an HTTP response body the SDK has only JSON-decoded, not a value anyone has
 * checked against the RESP value space, so {@link wrapUpstash} calls it with
 * no type argument (leaving it `unknown`) and runs the result through
 * {@link toRedisReply} before handing it to a caller. `get` mirrors the same
 * shape (`get<TData = unknown>`) for the same reason: the client is built
 * with `automaticDeserialization: false`, but that is a runtime configuration
 * choice the SDK's own type cannot see, so {@link wrapUpstash} narrows the
 * reply through {@link toRedisString} rather than trusting `TData`.
 *
 * `ping` and `del` stay concretely typed (`Promise<string>` /
 * `Promise<number>`) rather than adopting the same generic escape hatch:
 * `anti-slop/no-unknown-returns` is an error under `src/`, and only `eval`
 * and `get` have a generic default to fall back on — `ping`/`del` would
 * widen to a bare `Promise<unknown>`, which the rule forbids. Each is still
 * narrowed at the call site below ({@link toRedisString}, {@link
 * toRedisInteger}) so an SDK that returns something else is caught, not
 * assumed.
