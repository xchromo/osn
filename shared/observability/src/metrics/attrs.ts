/**
 * Canonical string-literal unions for common metric attributes.
 *
 * Rule: every metric attribute value MUST be a bounded union (closed set
 * of strings known at compile time). This is how we prevent cardinality
 * explosions — the type system rejects `userId: string`, `requestId: string`,
 * or any other unbounded field.
 *
 * If you need a new union, add it here and export it. Do NOT widen any
 * existing union without thinking about cardinality impact.
