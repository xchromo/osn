/**
 * Deny-list based redaction for log annotations and error causes.
 *
 * # Goal
 *
 * Stop secret-bearing values from leaving the process via the logger. Every
 * `Effect.log*` call routes annotations and `cause` payloads through this
 * scrubber before serialization (see `./layer.ts`), so any object key listed
 * here is replaced with `[REDACTED]` regardless of where it appears in the
 * tree.
 *
 * # When to add a key
 *
 * Add a key here when **all** of the following are true:
 *
 *   1. The name is used as an actual object property somewhere in the
 *      codebase — a DB column, a request body field, a response field, an
 *      Effect tagged-error field, an HTTP header name, etc. We do not pad
 *      this list with hypothetical secret names; if a field doesn't exist,
 *      don't pre-emptively guard it. The `osn:lint:redact-coverage` mental
 *      model is "every entry should have a `grep` hit outside this file".
 *
 *   2. Logging the value would be a security or privacy regression — auth
 *      credentials (tokens, passkey assertions), private keys, or PII that
 *      we have a policy commitment to keep out of operator-readable logs
 *      (per CLAUDE.md: `userId` is OK; `email` and `handle` are not).
 *
 *   3. There is no safer alternative on the call site. If the call site is
 *      `Effect.annotateLogs({ email })`, prefer fixing the call site to use
 *      `userId` instead. The deny-list is the *second* line of defence,
 *      not the first.
 *
 * Add **both** the camelCase and snake_case spelling if the field is reached
 * in both forms (Drizzle returns camelCase from the TS layer but raw column
 * names — and OAuth wire format — surface snake_case).
 *
 * # When to remove a key
 *
 * Remove a key only when the underlying field is gone from the codebase
 * (schema column dropped, route body removed, type deleted). When that
 * happens, drop the entry from this list and the matching assertion in
 * `redact.test.ts` in the same commit so the deny-list never drifts.
 *
 * # What does NOT belong here
 *
 *   - Generic identifiers like `code` or `id` — too broad, would scrub PKCE
 *     codes, event IDs, etc. The right fix is to never log the whole
 *     in-memory store entry, not to redact the field name.
 *
 *   - Speculative entries for features that haven't been built. When the
 *     Signal/E2E messaging code lands in `@zap/api`, the PR that adds
 *     `ciphertext` / `ratchetKey` / `senderKey` to a schema also adds
 *     them here. Until then, they aren't fields, so they aren't on the list.
 *
 *   - Fields whose values are public by design — `publicKey`, `credentialId`
 *     (the WebAuthn handle, not the credential bytes), avatar URLs.
 *
 * # Matching rules
 *
 * Case-insensitive on the key name. No regex — exact key match only — to
 * keep the rule auditable and avoid surprising over-redaction.

 * pointing at the call site so reviewers can confirm the entry is earning
