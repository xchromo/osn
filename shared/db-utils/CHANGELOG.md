# @utils/db

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 8732b5a: Audit and update dependencies across all workspaces: align version drift (typescript, vitest, solid-js), bump minor versions (drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit, @effect/vitest, @effect/opentelemetry, OTel exporters, @solidjs/router), and apply patches (@astrojs/solid-js, @astrojs/check).

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 97f35e5: Restructure the monorepo by domain. Top-level directories are now `osn/`, `pulse/`, and `shared/`, with matching workspace prefixes (`@osn/*`, `@pulse/*`, `@shared/*`). Key renames:

  - `@osn/osn` (apps/osn) → `@osn/app` (osn/app)
  - `@osn/pulse` (apps/pulse) → `@pulse/app` (pulse/app)
  - `@osn/api` (packages/api) → `@pulse/api` (pulse/api) — this package has always been Pulse's events server, the `@osn/` prefix was misleading
  - `@utils/db` → `@shared/db-utils`
  - `@osn/typescript-config` → `@shared/typescript-config`

  `@osn/core` remains unchanged as the OSN identity library consumed by `@osn/app`. The prefix rule going forward: `@osn/*` = identity stack, `@pulse/*` = events stack, `@shared/*` = cross-cutting utilities.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 880e762: Add `@utils/db` package (`packages/utils-db`) with shared database utilities — `createDrizzleClient` and `makeDbLive` — eliminating boilerplate duplication between `@osn/db` and `@pulse/db`. Both db packages now delegate client creation and Layer setup to `@utils/db`. Also removes the unused singleton `client.ts` export from both db packages.
