# @utils/db

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 880e762: Add `@utils/db` package (`packages/utils-db`) with shared database utilities — `createDrizzleClient` and `makeDbLive` — eliminating boilerplate duplication between `@osn/db` and `@pulse/db`. Both db packages now delegate client creation and Layer setup to `@utils/db`. Also removes the unused singleton `client.ts` export from both db packages.
