/**
 * Property tests for the search string-math.
 *
 * `src/search.ts` states its invariants as facts in prose — `handlePrefixRange`
 * is "exactly equivalent" to `handle LIKE 'q%'`, `escapeLike` makes a typed
 * metacharacter "match itself", the `QUERY_SEPARATOR` exemption means `%`, `_`
 * and `\` "stay inside the token and reach `escapeLike`". `search.test.ts`
 * checks those claims against examples someone thought of; these check them
 * against generated input, which is the only way a claim with the word
 * *exactly* in it can be held to its word.
 *
 * Written with bare `FastCheck` from `effect/testing` rather than
 * `@effect/vitest`'s `it.prop`, because `@shared/db-utils` does not depend on
 * `@effect/vitest` and none of this needs an Effect runtime — the functions
 * under test are deliberately dependency-free string math.
 *
 * The domains are pinned tightly on purpose. An over-broad arbitrary is worse
 * than no test: it either fails on input the function never promised to handle,
 * or it wanders so far from the real input space that the interesting branch is
 * never reached. Every generator below either derives from the handle charset
 * the source constrains itself to, or draws from an explicit alphabet chosen so
 * the LIKE metacharacters actually show up.

   * not start with" ten thousand times and the interesting branch never. These
   * five shapes are the ones that decide the property:
   *
   * - `q` itself and `q + tail` — the range must contain them.
   * - an unrelated handle — it usually must not.
   * - `q` with its **last character replaced** — the near miss that pins the
   *   upper bound. The bound is `charCodeAt(last) + 1`, and the handle charset
   *   is not contiguous in code order (`9` is 0x39, `_` is 0x5F, `a` is 0x61),
   *   so this is where an off-by-one or a charset assumption would show.
   * - `q` with its last character dropped — a string `q` is a prefix *of*,
   *   which must fall below the lower bound.
   * - the upper bound itself, and the upper bound with a suffix. Without these
   *   two the property passes against an implementation that returns a
   *   *closed* `[lower, upper]` range, because no other shape here can land
