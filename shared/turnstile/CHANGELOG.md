### Patch Changes

- 8226487: Refresh dependencies across the monorepo (routine maintenance audit).

  Security-relevant: `@simplewebauthn/server` 13.3.0 → 13.3.2 closes
  GHSA-6hxq-p678-4hr2 (CVSS v4 Low 2.0), where a maliciously-crafted attestation
  `x5c` could present a self-signed "root certificate" rather than chaining to an
  RP-specified trust anchor. Reached through `verifyRegistrationResponse()` on the
  passkey registration path. Exposure was nil rather than merely limited: we
  configure no trust anchors anywhere, so `validateCertificatePath` short-circuits
  on `trustAnchorsPEM.length === 0` and no chain decision was ever made — in
  13.3.0 as much as in 13.3.2. Tracked as S-L102, which also records why
  `attestationType: "none"` is _not_ the control here.

  `jose` moves 6.2.3 → 6.2.4 only, which is a docs update plus an `exportJWK`
  refactor that drops `undefined`-valued properties. That change is inert for us:
  `exportKeyToJwk` immediately `JSON.stringify`s its result, and `thumbprintKid`
  feeds RFC 7638 canonicalisation over `kty`/`crv`/`x`/`y`, so existing `kid`s and
  stored JWKs are byte-identical. The JOSE input-validation hardening (Base64URL
  alphabet, UTF-8 in headers and claims, truncated ASN.1 key data, duplicate
  `crit`) is in **6.2.5**, which this branch does _not_ take — it published
  2026-07-29 and is inside the 3-day quarantine. That upgrade is tracked
  separately and matters, since `jose` sits under both ARC S2S tokens and the
  5-minute `osn-access` JWTs.

  `effect` 3.21.2 → 3.22.0 (deprecates `Graph.neighborsDirected`, unused here),
  with `@effect/vitest` 0.29 → 0.30 and `@effect/opentelemetry` 0.63 → 0.64
  following its `^3.22.0` peer. `@effect/platform` is now an explicit
  `@shared/observability` dependency at `^0.97.0`: it was previously auto-installed
  at 0.94.5 purely to satisfy `@effect/opentelemetry`'s peer and did not actually
  meet it.

  `oxlint` 1.70 → 1.76 makes `vitest/expect-expect` effective inside `it.effect`
  bodies for the first time — the rule was already configured with
  `additionalTestBlockFunctions`, but earlier versions never walked those blocks.
  Ten `@osn/api` tests (of 644) were relying on "the Effect didn't fail" as their
  only assertion; each now asserts the behaviour its name claims, with no change
  to what is under test.

  The `@opentelemetry/*` SDK packages are held at `~2.9.0` rather than moved to
  2.10.0. The exporters and `sdk-logs` cannot follow yet — 0.221.0 is inside the
  14-day minor window — and the 0.220.0 exporters pin `core`/`resources`/
  `sdk-metrics`/`sdk-trace` to exactly 2.9.0, so taking only the SDK half splits
  the tree across two lines and links 2.10.0 packages against `core@2.9.0`. The
  tilde is deliberate: `^2.9.0` still admits 2.10.0. The whole line moves together
  once the exporters are eligible (2026-08-04).

  The root `esbuild` override rises `^0.27.0` → `^0.28.1`, closing
  GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr. The override had inverted from protective to harmful:
  wrangler 4.114 pins `esbuild 0.28.1` — the fixed version — and the `^0.27.0`
  floor was clamping the whole tree back down to the vulnerable 0.27.7. astro
  already declares `^0.28.0`, so `^0.28.1` now agrees with both consumers instead
  of fighting either. `bun audit` reports no vulnerabilities.

  `oxfmt` 0.44 → 0.59 spans four breaking formatter changes, but produces no
  output change here: the `fmt` script already excludes CSS, astro and markdown,
  and the `sort_imports` reclassification of subpath imports matches nothing in
  the tree. `bun run fmt` is a no-op on the current sources and `fmt:check` is
  clean. 0.60/0.61 stay out until they clear the 14-day minor window.

  Everything else is a patch/minor bugfix bump with no migration steps.

### Minor Changes

- d81383d: Add Cloudflare Turnstile bot protection to the OSN auth surface (key-optional, fail-closed).

  New `@shared/turnstile` package exposes `createTurnstileVerifier(secret?)` — a key-optional, fail-closed siteverify helper. When the `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` secret is **unset** the verifier is `null` and every gate is skipped (flows behave exactly as before — safe to merge before the widget exists). When **set**, it POSTs the token to Cloudflare's managed `siteverify` endpoint via `instrumentedFetch`, passing the caller's `cf-connecting-ip` as `remoteip`, and rejects on any missing / invalid / expired / duplicate (single-use) token or unreachable endpoint. The secret is never logged or returned to the client.

  - **`@osn/api`**: `/register/begin` and `/login/passkey/begin` are gated. The verifier is built once per isolate in `build-deps.ts` from `env.TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` and threaded through `createAuthRoutes`; a configured gate fails closed with `400 turnstile_failed`. New bounded metric `osn.auth.turnstile.rejected{endpoint}`.
  - **`@osn/client`**: `RegistrationClient.beginRegistration` and `LoginClient.passkeyBegin` accept an optional `turnstileToken`, sent on the begin call (omitted cleanly when absent — the no-Turnstile call shape is unchanged, and the silent conditional-UI passkey ceremony carries no token).
  - **`@osn/ui`**: new `TurnstileWidget` (Solid) renders Cloudflare's widget only when a `siteKey` prop is provided (lazy-loads `api.js`, `data-action="turnstile-spin-v1"`); `Register` + `SignIn` take an optional `turnstileSiteKey` prop and gate submit on a solved challenge. Omitted ⇒ no widget, no gate.

  The sitekey is public (embedded in client HTML at build time via `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITEKEY`); the secret is a `wrangler secret` on osn-api. Both halves are optional and graceful, mirroring the maps-embed key and `OSN_EMAIL_OPTIONAL` precedents.
