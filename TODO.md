# OSN Project TODO

Progress tracking and deferred decisions. For full spec see README.md. For code patterns see CLAUDE.md.

## Current Status

OSN Core auth system implemented. `packages/core` (`@osn/core`) provides a full OIDC-style auth server: passkey (WebAuthn), OTP, and magic-link flows, JWT issuance/verification, PKCE authorization endpoint, token exchange and refresh. `packages/osn-db` schema updated with `users` + `passkeys` tables. `apps/osn` scaffolded as the auth server entry point. `@osn/client` receives a `getSession()` expiry check and `handleCallback` exposed from `AuthProvider`. `apps/pulse` gains a `CallbackHandler` component. 25 service tests + route integration tests in `packages/core`.

## Deferred Decisions

Decisions to revisit later. Add new items as they come up.

| Decision | Context | Revisit When |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Messaging app name | Need a catchy name | Before public launch |
| Social media platform name | Need a catchy name | Before starting Phase 3 |
| Effect.ts adoption | Trial underway in `packages/api` (events service complete) | After more service coverage |
| Supabase migration | Currently SQLite for simplicity | When scaling needed |
| Android support | iOS priority for now | Phase 3 |
| Self-hosting | Enterprise use case | Phase 3 |
| Payment handling | Deferred for Pulse ticketing | After core Pulse features |
| Two-way calendar sync | Currently one-way (Pulse → external) | Phase 2 |
| Community event-ended reporting | When 15–20 attendees report an event as ended, auto-finish it; host gets push notification to mark it finished | When attendee/messaging features land |
| Max event duration | Frontend should prompt for a max auto-finish duration (e.g. 4h) when creating events without an endTime | When Pulse event creation UI is built |

### OSN Core (`apps/osn`)
- [ ] Initialize Tauri app (`bunx tauri init`)
- [x] OAuth/OIDC provider implementation (`packages/core` — passkey, OTP, magic link, PKCE, JWT)
- [x] User registration/login (passkey + OTP + magic link in `@osn/core`)
- [x] `apps/osn` scaffolded (package.json, tsconfig, src/index.ts, .env.example)
- [ ] Social graph data model (connections, close friends, blocks)
- [ ] Per-app vs global blocking logic
- [ ] Interest profile selection (onboarding)
- [ ] Third-party app authorization flow

### Pulse (`apps/pulse`)
- [x] Initialize Tauri app with SolidJS (`bunx create-tauri-app`)
- [x] iOS target configured (`bunx tauri ios init`)
- [x] Event data model and schema
- [x] Event CRUD operations (list, today, get, create, update, delete)
- [x] Events surfaced to frontend via Eden client
- [x] Event lifecycle auto-transitions (on-read, no background job)
- [x] Event CRUD UI (create form, delete, Eden client, shadcn tokens)
- [x] Vitest setup + utils tests (formatTime, toDatetimeLocal, composeLabel)
- [x] Component tests for `LocationInput` debounce/abort logic and `CreateEventForm` end-time validation
- [ ] Frontend UX: prompt for max event duration when creating events without an endTime
- [ ] Add toast notification system (errors, warnings, info) — errors currently only logged to console or silently dropped
- [ ] Event discovery (location, category, datetime, friends, interests)
- [ ] "What's on today" default view
- [ ] Recurring events (series + instances)
- [ ] Event group chats (via messaging backend)
- [ ] Calendar view
- [ ] iCal export
- [ ] Hidden attendance option
- [ ] Organizer tools (moderation, blacklists)
- [ ] Venue pages

### Messaging (`apps/messaging`)
- [ ] Initialize Tauri app (`bunx tauri init`)
- [ ] Signal protocol research/implementation (`packages/crypto`)
- [ ] Direct/indirect mode architecture
- [ ] DM functionality
- [ ] Group chats
- [ ] Event chat linking (show event overview in settings)
- [ ] Backup options (cloud, self-hosted, local)
- [ ] Device transfer

### Backend (`packages/api`)
- [x] Basic Elysia setup
- [x] Eden client export
- [x] Effect.ts trial integration (events service)
- [x] Events domain module (list, today, get, create, update, delete)
- [x] Service + route tests (Vitest, 44 tests)
- [x] HTTP-level test for `GET /events?category=<value>` (service layer covered, route wiring untested)
- [x] HTTP-level 422 test for `PATCH /events/:id` with invalid `startTime`/`endTime`
- [ ] Batch status-transition `UPDATE`s in `listEvents`/`listTodayEvents` (currently N individual writes — W1)
- [ ] Eliminate extra `getEvent` round-trips in `createEvent`/`updateEvent` via `RETURNING *` — W2
- [ ] Add indexes on `status` and `category` columns in `pulse-db` events schema — I1
- [ ] OSN/messaging domain modules
- [ ] WebSocket setup for real-time
- [ ] REST endpoints for third-party consumers

### Security (follow-up PR)
- [ ] Add authentication/authorisation middleware to all API routes (OWASP A01) — H1
- [ ] Add ownership model to mutating event operations (create/update/delete) — H2
- [ ] Evaluate Photon (Komoot) geocoding privacy: keystrokes sent to third-party with no user notice — add consent UI or proxy — M1
- [ ] Cap `limit` query parameter in `listEvents` (min 1, max 100) and guard `NaN` → no-limit fallback — M2
- [ ] Lock down CORS `origin` before any non-local deployment — M3
- [x] `getSession()` returns expired tokens without checking `expiresAt` — expiry check added — M4
- [x] OTP generated with `Math.random()` (not cryptographically secure) — replaced with `crypto.getRandomValues` — M5
- [ ] OTP stored in process memory (`otpStore` Map) — lost on restart, not safe for multi-process; move to DB or Redis — M6
- [ ] Magic-link tokens generated with `Math.random()`-seeded `btoa` — replace with `crypto.getRandomValues` — M7
- [ ] No brute-force / rate-limit protection on OTP or magic-link verify endpoints — M8
- [ ] `jwtSecret` falls back to `"dev-secret"` when env var is absent; enforce required secret in production — M9
- [ ] `imageUrl` allows `data:` URIs; add CSP `img-src` header — L1
- [ ] Failed OAuth callback leaves PKCE verifier in `localStorage` — clear on state mismatch — L2
- [ ] `REDIRECT_URI` derived from `window.location.origin` at runtime — prefer explicit env var — L3
- [ ] PKCE `state` param not validated against a stored nonce before use — L4

### Database (`packages/osn-db` → `@osn/db`, `packages/pulse-db` → `@pulse/db`)
- [x] Split DB into per-app packages (osn-db, pulse-db)
- [x] Pulse: Drizzle + SQLite setup, event schema, migrations, schema smoke tests (3 tests)
- [x] OSN Core: User schema (users + passkeys tables, migration generated)
- [ ] OSN Core: Session schema (sessions, refresh tokens — JWT-based for now, no DB storage)
- [ ] OSN Core: Social graph schema (connections, blocks)
- [ ] Pulse: Event series schema
- [ ] Pulse: Chat/Message schema (via messaging backend)

### UI Components (`packages/ui`)
- [ ] Design system / tokens
- [ ] Button, Input, Card basics
- [ ] Chat interface (shared between Pulse and Messaging)
- [ ] Event card component
- [ ] Calendar component
