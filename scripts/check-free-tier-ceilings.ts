/**
 * Watch the Cloudflare free-tier counters and file one issue when a day gets
 * near a ceiling.
 *
 * `wiki/runbooks/free-tier-limits.md` used to list these ceilings and say to
 * watch them, which meant a person opening a dashboard. Nobody did, so the D1
 * rows-written ceiling was crossed on 2026-08-30 and again on 2026-09-09 and
 * was only found by hand on 2026-09-10 (xchromo/osn#979).
 *
 * Read-only. It asks Cloudflare's GraphQL analytics API for per-day, per-
 * database and per-script totals, compares each day against its ceiling, and
 * writes the result into one GitHub issue that it reopens and edits rather
 * than filing again. A week spent near the line is one thread.
 *
 * Everything above the CLI block is pure: feed it a parsed API response and a
 * database-name map, get back the breaches and the issue body. The CLI block
 * is the only part that makes a network call, shells out to `gh`, or sets an
 * exit code.
 *
 * Fails loudly. Any bad response — a non-2xx, a GraphQL error, an account the
 * token cannot see, a field that is not a number — throws. A watcher that
 * reports all-clear when it is broken is worse than no watcher.

// Worker and every database on the account; the three daily ones reset at UTC
// midnight and storage is a running total.
//
// These are the documented limits as of 2026-09-10 and they WILL drift.
// Re-read Cloudflare's own pages before acting on a figure here —
// https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/ and
// https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/pricing/. The same numbers are
// in `wiki/runbooks/free-tier-limits.md` and have to move with these.

// Storage uses a decimal gigabyte, which is how Cloudflare prices it. Were it
// binary the true ceiling would be larger, so this errs toward warning early.
