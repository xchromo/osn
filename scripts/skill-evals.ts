/**
 * The inner loop for the agent skills in `.claude/skills/`.
 *
 * A full `tessl eval run` over every scenario, both variants, three runs each,
 * is sixty agent solves — most of a working day and hundreds of credits.
 * Almost none of that work is needed to answer the question a skill edit
 * actually asks, which is "did this scenario move". These subcommands narrow
 * the run to the skills the diff touched, and keep a committed scoreboard so
 * the next run has something to be compared against.
 *
 *   changed      --base <ref>              skills whose files the diff touched
 *   subset       --skills a,b --out <dir>  their scenarios, copied for a run
 *   fingerprint  <scenario-dir>            hash of everything but the skill
 *   check-names                            every scenario names a real skill
 *   plan                                   what a run now would cost, and why
 *   ready        --run <view.json>         has every variant been scored yet
 *   compare      --run <view.json>         markdown table against the scoreboard
 *   record       --run <view.json>         write those scores back
 *
 * `compare` is deliberately not a gate. At `-n 1` a scenario's score swings
 * further between identical runs than most real regressions do, so the table
 * is for a human to read in the pull request. The gate is `tessl review run
 * quality`, which is deterministic.
