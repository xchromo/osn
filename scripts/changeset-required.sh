# Decide whether a PR must carry a changeset, given its list of changed files on
# stdin (one path per line). Prints "required" or "skip"; always exits 0.
#
# Why this exists: some PRs touch nothing that any versioned package ships —
# Swift/Xcode scaffolding, CI workflows, wiki pages. Forcing a changeset there
# means naming an unrelated package and writing a false changelog entry.
#
# The test is an ALLOWLIST, deliberately. Skip only when every changed path is
# known not to version anything; anything else requires a changeset. The
# opposite shape (skip unless some known-versioned path was touched) leaks:
# `bun.lock`, root `tsconfig.json`, `turbo.json` and `bunfig.toml` all change
# what deployed packages build from while living outside every workspace
# directory, so a denylist waves a `bun update` through with no changelog.
#
# Invoked by .github/workflows/changeset-check.yml. Tests in
# scripts/changeset-required.test.sh.
