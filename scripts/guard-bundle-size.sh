# Guard the size of an Astro app's deployed bundle.
#
# Tracker #287: cire/invites' SSR Worker bundle reached 470 KB gzip unnoticed,
# from two separate mistakes. Three `.motion.ts` modules dragged the whole
# `motion` library into the SSR module graph though nothing there ever ran it
# (fixed by stubbing `motion` out of the SSR build only, see
# cire/invites/astro.config.mjs); and three drift-guard tests sat un-prefixed
# under `src/pages`, so Astro routed them, deployed them, and pulled 119 KB
# gzip of vitest along with them (fixed by the `_` prefix Astro's router
# excludes). This guard measures the same total again on every build and
# fails the moment it grows past a set point, rather than the growth being
# found from a tracker issue months later.
#
# Tracker #619 generalised it: cire/invites is the only `output: "server"`
# Astro app in the repo (it emits `dist/server`, a Worker, plus `dist/client`,
# its Static Assets). `cire/host`, `cire/landing`, `cire/vendor`, `osn/landing`
# and `pulse/landing` are all `output: "static"` — no Worker, no `dist/server`,
# no `dist/client` split; they deploy `dist` wholesale to Cloudflare Pages. The
# two shapes need different measurements, so this script takes a MODE rather
# than trying to force one glob to fit both:
#
#   worker  — cire/invites. Measures `dist/server`, and separately refuses any
#             `*.map` under the sibling `dist/client`.
#   static  — the other five. Measures `dist/_astro/*.js` and
#             `dist/_astro/*.css` only.
#
# Every app's mode and threshold is a row in scripts/bundle-size-budgets.txt —
# that file, not this script, not a workflow, not a package.json, is the
# single source of truth. A threshold living in one place is the whole point:
# it used to be a `<package-dir> <mode> <threshold>` argument, copied by hand
# into six package.json build scripts, a ci.yml step and eight deploy.yml
# steps — eight to fourteen copies of the same number, silently divergeable by
# missing one on a re-baseline. There is deliberately no way to pass a
# threshold on the command line any more.
#
# Usage:
#   guard-bundle-size.sh <package-dir>   — look up <package-dir>'s own record
#                                           in bundle-size-budgets.txt and run
#                                           it. What every package.json build
#                                           script and every deploy.yml step
#                                           calls.
#   guard-bundle-size.sh --all           — run every record in the budgets
#                                           file. What ci.yml's single step
#                                           calls.
#
# <package-dir> is resolved and `cd`'d into, so it can be a relative path from
# wherever the caller runs (a workflow step's cwd, or `.` from inside the
# package's own `build` script) or an absolute one. It is then matched against
# the budgets file by the LABEL derived from the resolved directory — the last
# two path segments (e.g. "cire/host") — so `.` and `../../cire/host` both key
# off the same row. A package directory with no matching row is an error, not
# a skip: a guard that silently does nothing for an app nobody added is
# exactly the failure mode this family of guards exists to prevent.
#
# BUNDLE_SIZE_BUDGETS_FILE overrides the budgets file path, and
# BUNDLE_SIZE_BUDGETS_ROOT overrides the root `--all` resolves each of its
# package-dir paths against (real usage: the repo root, since a row is a
# repo-relative path; the CLI test points both at a fixture tree instead).
