/**
 * Counts warning-severity diagnostics from an oxlint `--format=json` report.
 *
 * xchromo/osn#1008: `bun run lint`'s human-readable output has no summary
 * line in the oxlint version this repo pins (verified: a clean run ends on
 * the last diagnostic, nothing after it), so `grep -c " warning "` over that
 * output is the only text-based option — and it is fragile three ways: a
 * file path could itself contain the string, a rule's own message text can
 * say "warning" without being one line-per-diagnostic, and the format can
 * change under an oxlint upgrade with nothing here noticing. `--format=json`
 * instead gives one object per diagnostic with an explicit
 * `"severity": "warning" | "error"` field, stamped by oxlint itself rather
 * than inferred from text — filtering on that field is exact regardless of
 * message wording or output layout. Verified against this repo's real
 * output before this script was written: a clean `oxlint -c oxlintrc.json .
 * --format=json` reports 1059 warning-severity diagnostics, matching the
 * line count of the human-readable form on the same run.
 *
 * scripts/guard-lint-warnings.sh runs oxlint itself (real invocation, real
 * config) and hands this script the resulting JSON file path — this module
 * owns only the counting, so it can be unit-tested against a fixture report
 * with no oxlint invocation at all. See scripts/tests/lint-warning-count.test.ts
 * (the pure functions below) and .cli.test.ts (this file's CLI entry point).
