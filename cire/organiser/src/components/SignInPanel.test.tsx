/**
 * The login surface is one hand-off through one door: the portal cannot run a
 * WebAuthn ceremony for `musubi.social`, so the button sends the organiser to
 * cire/api's OIDC start leg and the issuer takes it from there. There is no
 * second "create account" door, and that absence is asserted rather than
 * assumed — the issuer's own sign-in screen offers sign-up, and only the issuer
 * knows whether this person already has an account. What else is worth pinning
 * down: the page does not leave on its own, it carries the dashboard as the
 * return target, and a failure coming back through `?auth_error` is shown once
 * and then wiped from the address bar.
 *
 * The one thing that does happen unbidden is the session check: an organiser
 * who still holds a cire session is carried through to the dashboard rather
 * than asked for a second one. It runs behind the rendered page, so the button
 * is there either way.
