/**
 * The portal's button.
 *
 * Every control in the dashboard was already one of four shapes — a solid gold
 * commit, a gold-outlined secondary, a neutral-outlined quiet action, and a
 * destructive one — written out longhand at each of the ~40 call sites, which is
 * why three of them had drifted to a different padding and two to a different
 * tracking. This is those four, named.
 *
 * ## No haptic here
 *
 * Tempting, and wrong. The vocabulary in `haptics.ts` is deliberately five
 * names, fired at the moment a change *takes* — not at the moment a button is
 * pressed. A press that opens a dialog, switches a tab or starts a request that
 * then fails has nothing to confirm yet. Buzzing on every press is exactly the
 * "phone in a pocket buzzing through a seating chart" the module warns about.
 *
 * ## About `class`
 *
 * The prop is appended, and there is no `tailwind-merge` in this package, so it
 * is for what the variant does not decide — `self-start`, `w-full`, a grid
 * placement. Two competing utilities land in source order, not in the order they
 * are written here. Anything that needs a different colour or padding wants a
 * new variant, not an override.
