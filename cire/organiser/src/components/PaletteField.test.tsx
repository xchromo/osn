/**
 * The scheme editor: five seed pickers, the curated presets, and the live
 * preview. What is asserted here is the vocabulary and the two behaviours an
 * organiser cannot undo — a preset discarding their earlier nudges, and a nudge
 * landing on the right seed.
 *
 * The labels are the seed NAMES (Ground / Card / Ink / Gilt / Bloom), the same
 * words used by `@cire/theme`, the API schema and the wiki. A picker whose label
 * drifted from its `PaletteSeeds` key would still render — it would just ask the
 * organiser for one colour and change another — so each is pinned to its key.
