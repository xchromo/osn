/**
 * The invite's CLOSING SECTION — the couple's own sign-off: an optional image
 * (monogram, motif, signature) over an optional closing note ("Looking forward
 * to celebrating with you", "No boxed gifts please").
 *
 * This is a SECTION OF THE INVITE, not part of the site footer:
 *   - `SiteFooter.astro` is site-wide chrome — the couple's title plus the legal
 *     links + privacy control. It renders on EVERY document (invite, /privacy,
 *     /terms, 404) and must always be there (compliance blocker C-H4).
 *   - This is invite content, rendered by `InvitePage` as the last thing above
 *     that footer, and — like the events list — only AFTER the guest has
 *     claimed their code. It is behind the unlock because it is addressed to
 *     the invited household, not to anyone who happens to have the URL.
 *
 * Like the hero and Our Story it is a conditional segment: with neither a note
 * nor an image it renders NOTHING — no empty surface, no stray band above the
 * footer.
 *
 * SURFACE — it deliberately has NO tone setting of its own. It paints whatever
 * the organiser chose for the "Code Entry & Welcome" section (`themeVars`,
 * supplied by the caller as `sectionVars(theme, "welcome")`): the welcome
 * greeting and this closing note are the couple's two direct addresses to their
 * guests, so they read as a matched pair, and the builder gains no extra knob.
 *
 * NAMING — storage and the wire say `footer_*` / `footer` (the invite's footer
 * section, and the image slot's R2 namespace + public URL segment), while the
 * organiser-facing label is "Closing Section". Deliberate, not drift: showing an
 * organiser "footer" next to a page that also has a legal footer would be
 * ambiguous about which one they are editing.
 */

/**
 * The closing image's display shape when no crop was saved (or a legacy crop
