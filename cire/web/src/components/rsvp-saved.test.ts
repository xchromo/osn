 * The RSVP confirmation is choreographed across three places that cannot see
 * each other: Tailwind utilities on the button (the sweep), a keyframe in
 * `global.css` (the tick), and a `setTimeout` in `RsvpModal` (the dwell before
 * the sheet closes). Nothing in the toolchain relates them — happy-dom computes
 * no CSS, so no component test can observe the real timing, and every
 * combination type-checks and builds.
 *
 * These are the guards that relate them. The class-level half (the button
 * really does carry `duration-500`, `origin-left`, `scale-x-0`) lives in
 * `RsvpModal.test.tsx`, next to the markup it is pinning.
