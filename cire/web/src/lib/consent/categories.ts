/**
 * Consent categories — the unit a guest actually grants or refuses.
 *
 * The site-wide consent flow is category-based, not vendor-based: a guest
 * toggles "third-party embeds", not "Pinterest" and "Google Maps" separately.
 * Vendors declare which category they belong to (see `vendors.ts`), so adding a
 * third party is a registry entry rather than a new gate, a new storage key and
 * a new prompt — which is exactly what the bespoke Pinterest gate used to be.
 *
 * WHY THESE FOUR (and not the usual six-category cookie-banner boilerplate):
 * every category here maps to something the guest site genuinely does. We
 * deliberately do NOT define a `marketing` / `advertising` category — offering a
 * toggle for something we don't do invites the reasonable question of whether we
 * secretly do it, and an unused toggle is a claim we'd have to keep true.
 *
 * `necessary` is not optional and renders as a locked control. Under ePrivacy
 * (and the GDPR recitals behind it) storage that is strictly necessary to
 * provide the service the guest asked for needs no consent — the claim-code
 * session cookie, the bot check that protects it, and the record of this very
 * decision. Everything else defaults to OFF until the guest says otherwise.
