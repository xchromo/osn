/**
 * STRIPE CONNECT, as much of it as cire touches.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. A guest gives money to a couple. The couple are the merchant
 * of record — direct charges on their own connected account — so the money goes
 * from the guest's card to the couple's bank and cire never holds it. That is
 * the whole reason the integration is Connect rather than a platform checkout:
 * holding gift funds, even in transit, is money transmission, and this product
 * is not going anywhere near it.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO `stripe` PACKAGE HERE. Three endpoints and one signature check
 * do not justify the official SDK on a Worker: it is built around Node's http
 * stack, and cire-api ships inside a 1MB compressed Worker budget it already
 * shares with Elysia, Drizzle and Effect (see `wiki/runbooks/free-tier-limits`).
 * The REST API is form-encoded POSTs and JSON replies; `fetch` is the whole
 * client. If this file ever grows past the handful of calls the gift flow needs,
 * that trade is worth re-running — it is a trade, not a principle.
 *
 * KEY-OPTIONAL, AND FAIL-CLOSED. `createStripeClientFromEnv` returns `null`
 * without a secret key, exactly as `@shared/turnstile` does: a deployment with
 * no Stripe configuration exposes no payment surface at all rather than a broken
 * one. What it must never do is the other failure — a missing key silently
 * meaning "allowed".
 *
 * WHAT NEVER REACHES A LOG. The secret key, obviously; but also Stripe's raw
 * error bodies, which can echo request parameters back. `StripeError` carries a
 * fixed reason, the HTTP status and Stripe's own machine-readable `code`, and
 * nothing else.
