/**
 * Delivery of the retention sweep's parting gift summary.
 *
 * The sweep deletes a wedding's guest data a year after its last event, and
 * leaves the couple an aggregate on `registry_settings`. This is the half that
 * actually reaches them: it asks osn-api for the organiser's address (cire
 * stores none of its own) and sends one email per wedding.
 *
 * Everything here is fail-soft, on purpose. By the time this runs the deletes
 * have committed — the obligation is discharged and the email is a courtesy.
 * A dead mailbox, a 500 from osn-api, a Resend outage: each costs one couple
 * one email and nothing else. There is no retry anywhere in this file, because
 * the caller is a cron sweep and a retry loop against a mailbox that is still
 * down would only mail the same couple again on the next run with no new data.
