/**
 * An event's time is a WALL CLOCK plus an IANA zone — never a UTC offset.
 *
 * That is the model the organiser portal's drawer has used since the offset
 * picker was removed: an offset is a fact ABOUT a zone on a particular date, not
 * a property of the event, so "+10:00" typed for a Sydney wedding in November is
 * simply wrong and nothing catches it. This module is the SHEET path's half of
 * the same rule — the uploaded `Start` / `End` cells state local time, the
 * `Timezone` column says which zone that clock is on, and the offset the stored
 * timestamp carries is DERIVED here (DST-correctly, for that event's own date).
 *
 * Why the stored value keeps an offset at all: `events.start_at` / `end_at` are
 * read as INSTANTS by the guest site (`new Date(startAt)` for the day/time
 * render and the ICS + Google Calendar links) and sorted as instants by
 * `lib/event-order.ts`. An offsetless string parses against the VIEWER's zone in
 * every one of those places, so the offset stays as an internal, always-derived
 * detail of the storage format. It is not something an organiser types or sees:
 * the CSV template, the CSV parser, the exports and the editor all speak wall
 * clock + zone.
 *
 * The client twin of {@link zoneOffsetAt} is `cire/organiser/src/lib/timezones.ts`
 * (the drawer stamps the same offset onto an edited event). Same two-pass DST
 * resolution, same answers — duplicated only because this module is server-side
 * and the organiser bundle cannot import from `@cire/api`.
