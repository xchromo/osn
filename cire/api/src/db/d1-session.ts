/**
 * D1 Sessions API wiring: route every query a request makes through one D1
 * session, so read replicas can serve the second and later queries.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * Without a session, each `prepare()` is an independent query and D1 sends all
 * of them to the primary database. cire's primary lives in Oceania, so a
 * request served from a European or North American colo pays the full
 * round-trip to Sydney *per query* — a request that reads three tables pays it
 * three times. With read replication enabled, a session pins the first query to
 * the primary and lets every later query in the same session be served by any
 * replica that has caught up to the bookmark the first query returned. The
 * round trips collapse from N × (distance to Sydney) to one, plus N-1 local
 * reads.
 *
 * This is safe to deploy BEFORE replication is turned on: with no replicas, a
 * session behaves exactly like today (every query goes to the primary), so the
 * change is inert until the database has replicas to serve from.
 *
 * ## The constraint, and why it is `first-primary`
 *
 * {@link D1_SESSION_CONSTRAINT} is `"first-primary"`, never
 * `"first-unconstrained"`. `first-primary` sends the first query of the session
 * to the primary, so a request ALWAYS observes every write committed before it
 * started — the ordinary read-your-writes expectation, including across
 * requests (a guest who RSVPs and then reloads, an organiser who saves an edit
 * and then re-reads it). `first-unconstrained` gives that up for one saved
 * round trip on the first query, and cire has at least one route that
 * explicitly cannot take it: `routes/invite.ts` serves a `no-store`,
 * edit-sensitive payload precisely so organiser edits surface on the guest
 * invite's revalidation. One constraint for the whole Worker keeps that
 * property from depending on which route happened to be reached.
 *
 * ## How it threads through
 *
 * The Elysia app graph is built ONCE per isolate (see `index.ts`) with the
 * Drizzle handle baked in, and ~50 route factories close over that handle — so
 * a per-request Drizzle client is not something the app can be handed. Instead
 * the handle is built over a *stable* client shim whose `prepare`/`batch`
 * delegate to whichever session is current on the async context, established
 * per request by {@link runInD1Session}. Outside a session (unit tests, the
 * bun:sqlite dev server, a handler that somehow escaped the async context) the
 * shim falls through to the raw binding, which is exactly today's behaviour —
 * so losing the context degrades to "always primary", never to a wrong answer.
 */

/**
 * The half of `D1Database` that Drizzle's D1 driver actually calls.
 * `drizzle-orm@0.45.2`'s `d1/session.js` uses `client.prepare(sql)` and
 * `client.batch(statements)` and nothing else — no `exec`, no `dump` — which is
 * also exactly what a `D1DatabaseSession` exposes. Naming the narrow type here
 * lets a session stand in for a database without pretending it is one.
