 * be recalled — a rename feature needs slug tombstoning first (S-M1, tracked
 * in cire wiki/todo/security.md).

 * stops accepting RSVPs. `rsvpDeadlineTimezone` names the zone that day is

 * clearing the date clears the zone — so a zone can never outlive its date.

 *     gate that disagrees with its writer is advisory. There is no
 *     prototype-pollution sink in this codebase today; this makes the
 *     agreement structural rather than dependent on that staying true.
 *  2. Deriving the key list from `UpdateSettingsBody.fields` means a field
 *     added to the struct is owner-only the moment it exists — the list cannot
 *     drift out of step with the schema, because it *is* the schema.
