 * over PUT (the app's CORS method list has no PATCH): omitted fields keep
 * their stored value, an explicit `null` clears a nullable field. `displayName`
 * and `currency` are NOT NULL columns, so they can be replaced but never
 * cleared. Location is deliberately absent — an event's place is its free-text
 * `address` (the sole location source); the wedding holds only the MAIN
 * currency + budget.
 * The SLUG is deliberately absent too (read-only in Settings): renaming frees
 * the old slug for another organiser to claim, and printed invite links can't
 * be recalled — a rename feature needs slug tombstoning first (S-M1, tracked
 * in cire wiki/todo/security.md).
 *
 * `rsvpDeadline` is the one field here that guests feel: past it the invite
 * stops accepting RSVPs. `rsvpDeadlineTimezone` names the zone that day is
 * measured in (the portal sends the organiser's own). The service pairs them —
 * clearing the date clears the zone — so a zone can never outlive its date.
