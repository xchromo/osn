 *
 * Gate order: `sessionAuth` (401) → limiter (429). The limiter is LAST of the
 * two so an anonymous caller cannot spend a household's budget by hammering the
 * route. The visible-registry gate necessarily runs inside the handler — it
 * needs a slug→wedding read the middleware chain has no place for — so an
 * authenticated guest of an unpublished wedding does spend their OWN per-IP
 * budget on a 404. That is the intended shape: the budget is per-IP, so the only
 * caller they can exhaust is themselves.
 *
 * Per-IP, unlike the organiser registry writes, which are per-user: a guest has
 * no user. Sized for a household deciding on gifts, not for a form submit.
 *
 * No Turnstile. The `cire_session` cookie these routes require was minted by
 * `POST /api/claim`, which IS Turnstile-gated — the same argument `app.ts`
 * already records for the RSVP writes.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO "mark purchased" endpoint. A claim and a purchase are
 * the same unique `(item_id, family_id)` row in two states, so marking one
 * purchased is a POST with `status: "purchased"` — a second endpoint would be a
 * second way to write one row, and the two would drift.
 *
 * Error mapping, all as machine-readable codes (the `rsvp_closed` precedent):
 *
 *   RegistryNotVisible      → 404 `registry_not_found`
 *   RegistryItemNotInWedding→ 404 `registry_item_not_found`
 *   FamilyNotInWedding      → 404 `registry_item_not_found`  (see below)
 *   ItemFullyClaimed        → 409 `item_fully_claimed`
 *   InvalidQuantity         → 400 `invalid_quantity`
 *
 * `FamilyNotInWedding` answers as a missing ITEM on purpose. It fires when a
 * cookie for wedding A is used on wedding B's slug, and a distinct code there
 * would confirm to the holder of any valid cookie that a given item id exists on
 * a wedding they have no business reading.
