 *
 * Gate order: `sessionAuth` (401) → limiter (429). The limiter is LAST of the

 * budget on a 404. That is the intended shape: the budget is per-IP, so the only
 * caller they can exhaust is themselves.
 *
 * Per-IP, unlike the organiser registry writes, which are per-user: a guest has
 * no user. Sized for a household deciding on gifts, not for a form submit.
 *
 * No Turnstile. The `cire_session` cookie these routes require was minted by
 * `POST /api/claim`, which IS Turnstile-gated — the same argument `app.ts`
 * already records for the RSVP writes.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO "mark purchased" endpoint. A claim and a purchase are

 * purchased is a POST with `status: "purchased"` — a second endpoint would be a

 *   ItemFullyClaimed        → 409 `item_fully_claimed`
 *   InvalidQuantity         → 400 `invalid_quantity`
 *
 * `FamilyNotInWedding` answers as `registry_not_found` — the SAME code an
 * unpublished or unentitled registry gives (S-M1). It fires when a cookie for
 * wedding A is used on wedding B's slug, and the service checks it BEFORE the
 * item, so a holder of any valid cookie learns neither whether that wedding has
 * a list nor whether the item id they guessed exists on it. Answering a
 * distinct item-shaped code told them the second; answering it only when the
 * registry happened to be visible told them the first.
