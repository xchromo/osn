/**
 * Handle autocomplete for the add-co-host input. NOT wedding-scoped — it answers
 * "who might this organiser mean?", which any signed-in organiser may ask while
 * typing a co-host's handle. So it's gated by `osnAuth()` only (a valid OSN
 * access token), never `weddingOwner()`: the suggestion list isn't tied to a
 * wedding, and gating per-wedding would wrongly block an organiser autocompleting
 * before they've picked which wedding to add the host to.
 *
 * Two sources, deliberately ordered:
 *
 *   1. The caller's own **OSN connections** (`resolveOsnConnectionSearch`),
 *      matched on handle prefix or display-name substring. These come first
 *      because a wedding's co-hosts are nearly always people the organiser
 *      already knows on OSN — a partner, a sibling, the planner they connected
 *      with — and because picking a connection is the case where the organiser
 *      can be confident they've got the right @handle rather than a stranger
 *      with a confusable one.
 *   2. The global handle prefix search (`resolveOsnHandleSearch`), which fills
 *      the remainder. Kept because a co-host is *not required* to be a
 *      connection, and dropping it would turn "not connected yet" into "cannot
 *      be added" — a regression for exactly the planner-hired-last-week case.
 *
 * A profile that appears in both is emitted once, from the connections source,
 * so `connected` is never understated.
 *
 * The caller's own profile is filtered out of both: the owner already hosts the
 * wedding (`POST /hosts` answers 409 `owner_is_host`), so suggesting themselves
 * only leads to a dead end.
 *
 * Behaviour mirrors the host-list display path: KEY-OPTIONAL + FAIL-SOFT. With
 * no ARC resolvers (no ARC key) or an unavailable lookup, the route returns an
 * empty list — the manual type-and-submit add path on `POST /hosts` still works,
 * autocomplete just suggests nothing. Never a 503/500 for an autocomplete miss.
 *
 * An EMPTY query is valid and is not the same as a missing one: it returns the
 * organiser's first page of connections and nothing from the global search,
 * which is what lets the portal open its dropdown on focus, before a keystroke.
 * Enumeration guardrails (min prefix length on the global search, ordering,
 * result caps) live in osn-api; this route adds a light per-IP rate limit so an
 * authenticated organiser can't drive unbounded ARC-sign + S2S amplification by
 * spamming keystrokes.
