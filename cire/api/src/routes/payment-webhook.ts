 * Phase-2 landing spot for the payment provider's purchase webhook. Phase 2
 * uses Lemon Squeezy (merchant of record; Paddle fallback) — this skeleton is
 * PROVIDER-NEUTRAL so a swap is an adapter change. In Phase 1 it is INERT: it
 * verifies nothing and grants nothing, returning 501. createApp mounts it ONLY
 * when the webhook flag is set, so no unverified endpoint is ever exposed by
 * default.
 *
 * Phase 2 will: verify the provider signature, map the purchased product →
 * entitlement key, and call entitlementService.grant({ source: "purchase",
 * stripeRef: <provider order id> }) — idempotent on the provider order id.
