/**
 * CONNECTING A COUPLE'S BANK ACCOUNT — Stripe Connect onboarding, from the
 * organiser portal.
 *
 *   POST /api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/registry/stripe/session  (weddingOwner)
 *   POST /api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/registry/stripe/refresh  (weddingOwner)
 *
 * **Owner-only, not editor.** Every other registry write is `weddingEditor`,
 * because adding a gift is ordinary help. This is not: it names the bank account
 * the money lands in, and a co-host with edit rights has no business pointing a
 * couple's gifts at anything. The role split already exists for exactly this
 * kind of line (codes, deletion, co-host removal), and this belongs on the same
 * side of it.
 *
 * **Create-or-resume, never create-again.** Onboarding is a form people abandon
 * and come back to, and every return trip runs through this route. It reads the
 * settings row first: an account already on it is reused and only the hosted
 * link is fresh. Stripe's idempotency key is the second belt — a double-tapped
 * button cannot mint two connected accounts for one couple, which is the
 * failure that needs a human at Stripe to unpick.
 *
 * **Nothing here turns cash gifts ON.** Connecting an account and offering
 * guests a contribute button are two decisions, and the second is the couple's:
 * `PUT /registry/settings` still owns it, still refuses while Stripe cannot take
 * a charge (`stripe_not_ready`), and this route deliberately does not reach over
 * and set it for them.
 *
 * **Key-optional.** With no `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` the client is `null` and these
 * routes are not mounted at all, so a deployment without Stripe has no payment
 * surface rather than a broken one. Unlike the account-linking flag, the portal
 * does NOT probe: nothing in `@cire/host` reads a capability, the Money-gifts
 * panel renders on every tier, and a keyless deployment surfaces itself as the
 * 404 this route's absence produces when a couple presses Connect (C-L1).

 *
 * `status` and `code` only. `StripeError` carries no message precisely because
