# RSVP deadline

An organiser sets a **"kindly respond by" date** on their wedding. Guests see it on their invite and can reply — and change their reply — right up to the end of that day. Past it the invite **locks**: the guest write path refuses, and the invite renders read-only.

A wedding with no deadline behaves exactly as cire always did. Every wedding that existed before migration 0055 reads as "no deadline", so nothing changed for anyone until an organiser opts in.

## The one hard problem: a date is not an instant

"1 September" names a day, not a moment. Which moment it ends depends on where you stand — and a Sydney couple's guests can be reading from London.

Cire answers it the same way the `events` table already does: **wall-clock value + IANA zone**.

| Column (`weddings`) | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `rsvp_deadline` | `text` (nullable) | Date-only ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, **inclusive** of its whole day. `NULL` = no deadline. |
| `rsvp_deadline_timezone` | `text` (nullable) | IANA zone the day is measured in. `NULL` ⇒ UTC. |

The lock instant is the **last millisecond of that local day** — `23:59:59.999` in `rsvp_deadline_timezone`.

The zone is never picked by hand. The organiser portal stamps the organiser's own browser zone at the moment they *choose or change* the date, which is the day they mean. Saving an unrelated field later — possibly from another country — never re-stamps it.

### Why on `weddings`, not `wedding_invite_customisations`

The customisations table is documented as *strictly presentational*: every column there changes how the invite looks. This pair gates a **write**. Putting it on `weddings` keeps that table's contract honest and puts the deadline next to `wedding_date`, the other planning fact it belongs with.

### The single source of the instant

`cire/api/src/lib/rsvp-deadline.ts` is the only place a date becomes a moment.

```ts
resolveRsvpDeadline(date, timezone, now)
  // → { date, timezone, closesAt, closed } | null
isRsvpClosed(date, timezone, now)  // → boolean
```

Everything — the guest write gate, the claim payload, the guest banner — goes through it, so the server's 403 and the invite's "closed" copy can never disagree about when the door shut.

Offsets come from `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (no tz library on a Worker): format the instant into the zone, read the wall-clock fields back, and subtract. It runs **two passes** — the first offset is sampled at the UTC-interpreted instant, which is up to a day away from the real one and so can land on the wrong side of a DST transition; re-sampling at the corrected instant settles it. That is what makes "the end of 5 April in Sydney" resolve at `+10` (the day *ends* on AEST) rather than the `+11` in force when it began.

Formatters are **cached per zone** and reused across both passes (P-W1). Construction is the expensive half of ICU date handling (~226 µs/call vs ~16 µs cached) and this runs on every claim and every RSVP submit, against a 10 ms Workers CPU budget. Only *successful* lookups are cached, which is what bounds the map: a miss stores nothing, so junk input can't grow it, and canonicalisation on write (below) means only canonical identifiers ever reach it.

### Zones are canonicalised on write

`Intl` accepts more than "IANA identifier" — `"+05:30"`, `"utc"` and `"AUSTRALIA/sydney"` all construct. Storing those verbatim would mean a fixed-offset deadline that never applies DST (drifting an hour across a transition) and one zone spelled several ways in the column, so `canonicalTimeZone` resolves through `resolvedOptions().timeZone` and rejects anything whose resolved form is an offset (S-L2). It is deliberately **not** cached — it takes organiser-supplied strings, and caching by input would let case variants of one real zone grow a map without bound. It runs on a rare owner-gated write, never on a hot path.

### Failing open

Both degradations fail **open**, never closed:

- a stored date that isn't a real calendar date ⇒ **no deadline**;
- a zone this runtime can't resolve ⇒ **UTC**.

Locking guests out of an invite because of a data problem is the worse failure. The write path validates both at the boundary (`cire/api/src/schemas/settings.ts` — the zone is checked against the runtime's own ICU data, not a regex), so reaching either branch means data written by something else.

## Who the deadline stops

| Path | Gated? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/rsvp` (guest invite) | **Yes** — 403 `{ "error": "rsvp_closed" }` | The point of the feature. |
| `PUT …/guests/:guestId/rsvps/:eventId` (organiser-recorded) | **No** | A phone/paper reply arriving after the date is exactly the case the deadline creates. The organiser set the date; they can answer for it. |
| Host-preview family | Already 403 | Preview sessions never write real RSVP data, deadline or not. |

Enforcement lives on the **write**, not only in the UI: a stale tab, or anything talking to the API directly, must not be able to slip a late reply in. The route reads the deadline in the same join it already makes for the family's `kind`, so the gate costs no extra round-trip — and **fails closed on a zero-row join** (S-L1), since both gates read that one result and optional chaining would have made a missing row answer "allow" to each of them.

`cire.rsvp.blocked{reason}` counts refusals — `deadline` or `preview`.

## What the guest sees

The deadline rides the **claim payload** (`ClaimResponse.rsvpDeadline`), not the public `GET /api/invite/:slug` — it only means anything once a household is looking at its own events, the same reasoning as the closing section beside it.

```jsonc
"rsvpDeadline": {
  "date": "2026-09-01",
  "timezone": "Australia/Sydney",
  "closesAt": "2026-09-01T13:59:59.999Z",  // the instant it locks
  "closed": false                           // the verdict at claim time
}
```

Both `closesAt` and `closed` are sent because a guest can sit on a claimed invite for hours. `createRsvpClosed` (`cire/web/src/components/createRsvpClosed.ts`) schedules **one** timer at `closesAt` and re-derives the verdict — nothing polls, nothing wakes a sleeping phone — so an invite left open across the deadline locks itself instead of leading to a server 403. Delays beyond `setTimeout`'s 32-bit range are deliberately not scheduled (they would fire immediately and close a far-off invite on sight).

One verdict drives three surfaces, in both the `classic` and `gala` designs:

1. **A line directly on top of the event cards** — "Kindly respond by Tuesday 1 September 2026." while open; "RSVPs closed on …" once shut. One line governs every card (a per-card repeat would be four copies of one fact), so it is placed as the list's **label**, not as a third line of section header: in `classic` it leaves the centred header block and left-aligns with the cards; in `gala` it sits *below* the header rule. Both hold it tight to the list (`mb-3`) with nothing between. Pinned by a DOM-position test in each pack.
2. **Each card's Respond button** — relabelled "RSVPs closed" and marked `aria-disabled`. Relabelled rather than removed: a vanished button reads as a broken invite. **`aria-disabled`, not the native `disabled`** (C-M2): the native attribute takes the control out of the tab order, which would make the one per-card explanation of why the action is gone unreachable by keyboard, and would drop focus to `<body>` if the deadline passed while it was focused. The click handler enforces it, and `aria-describedby` points at the notice above via the shared `RSVP_NOTICE_ID` — the notice is the only place the *date* appears. Losing the native attribute also loses WCAG 1.4.3's inactive-component exemption, so the closed state reuses the **outlined** treatment already shipped beside it rather than dimming the filled button. *Event Details stays open* — only the answer locks.
3. **The RSVP sheet** — read-only: every control disabled, no submit button at all, the dismiss button says "Close". Normally unreachable (Respond can't be activated), but reachable if the deadline passes with the sheet already open — in which case unmounting the submit button would strand focus outside an `aria-modal` dialog, so a focus rescue moves it to the dismiss button *when nothing else holds it* (C-L2).

The dates render in the **wedding's** zone, so a guest abroad sees the date the couple wrote, not the one their own clock rolls it to.

A 403 from the write path is disambiguated by its body: `rsvp_closed` gets "RSVPs have closed for this wedding", anything else keeps the authorisation copy.

## Where the organiser sets it

**Settings → RSVP by**, via the same `PUT /api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/settings` PATCH-semantics body.

It is the **one field on that panel a co-host may write**. The rest of Settings is wedding identity and money — owner-only in the roles matrix — but the deadline *runs* the wedding rather than describing it: the co-host chasing replies is exactly the person who needs to move the date, and nothing they do to it is something an owner can't undo. A `viewer` co-host still gets nothing.

A middleware can't express "this field, not that one", so the route splits the decision in two:

| Layer | Decides |
|---|---|
| `weddingEditor()` | Who reaches the handler at all — owner or `editor`; a `viewer` gets its usual 403 `read_only_role`, a non-member the 404/403 pair. |
| The handler | Whether a **non-owner's** patch reached past the deadline. Any other key present ⇒ 403 `owner_only_fields` naming them. |

Shape is checked **before** privilege, so a co-host who typos a date is told the date is wrong rather than that they lack permission for a field they're allowed to write. The refusal is whole — a patch mixing the deadline with an owner-only field writes neither — and it is logged (`settings owner-only fields refused`), because the portal never sends that body, so every occurrence is a stale tab or a hand-crafted call. Rejected rather than silently filtered: a save that reports success while quietly discarding half the form is the worse failure.

The allow-list (`ownerOnlySettingsIn`, `cire/api/src/schemas/settings.ts`) is **derived from the request schema's own field list** rather than from the incoming object's keys. Two properties fall out: a field added to `UpdateSettingsBody` is owner-only from the moment it exists (the list can't drift, because it *is* the schema), and the check reads each key the same way the writer does — `patch[key]`, through the prototype chain — so gate and writer can never disagree about what a patch contains (S-M1).

The write is **narrow**: `weddingSettingsService.update` names only the columns the patch carries. The old full-row read-modify-write was harmless while the owner was the single writer, but with two principals on one row a co-host's deadline save would rewrite `displayName` and `currency` from a value read moments earlier, reverting an owner's concurrent edit to a field the gate exists to protect (S-L1). A deadline-only patch now emits a deadline-only `UPDATE`, so the field gate holds at the storage layer too. The pairing rule below still fires — but only for a patch that touches the pair, so an unrelated save writes nothing but its own columns.

Both deadline keys travel together on that list. Admitting the date without the zone would leave a co-host able to set a deadline they can't say the zone of — and the zone is what makes "the end of that day" mean anything.

The portal mirrors it: a co-host sees the profile fields disabled with the RSVP-by picker live, a **"Save RSVP-by date"** button (labelled for what it writes, since "Save settings" beside five disabled fields reads as a button about to overwrite them), and a body carrying the deadline pair *alone* — not the untouched values sitting in the disabled inputs, which would earn the 403.

The two columns are **one fact**: clearing the date clears the zone in the same write, whichever order a client sends them in, so a zone can never outlive its date and re-appear next to an empty field.

It is the only field on that panel guests feel, which is why its hint says so explicitly — and names the zone, since "the end of that day" means nothing without one.
