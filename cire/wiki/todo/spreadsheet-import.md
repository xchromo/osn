# Organiser Spreadsheet Import

Source spreadsheet has these columns: `Family ID, Guest First Name, Guest Last Name, Family Name, Catholic Wedding, Hindu Wedding, Reception, Mehndi`. Row grouping is by `Family Name`; only the last row of each family carries a Family ID in the source sheet (we ignore that — Cire generates its own `publicId`). Each guest row has booleans per event.

## Spreadsheet ingestion (cire/api)

- [x] `services/spreadsheet.ts` — `parseEventsCsv` / `parseGuestsCsv` (hand-rolled RFC 4180); rejects formula-injection cells (cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`) (PR-C; trim-resilient as of PR-C review)
- [x] `services/import.ts` — `diffAgainstDb(parsed)` returns `ImportPlan` (creates / updates / removes per family + per guest); `applyImport(plan)` executes in dependency order with per-statement chunking (PR-C)
- [x] **`diffAgainstDb` wedding-scoping** — `diffAgainstDb(parsedEvents, parsedFamilies, weddingId)` now scopes every read to `weddingId`: `events` / `families` filter on the column directly, `guests` / `guest_events` join through `families` (neither carries `wedding_id`). The link-table join is load-bearing — a naive per-table `WHERE` couldn't scope `guest_events` and would read a second wedding's links as removals. The interim `MultiWeddingImportUnsupported` fail-closed tripwire is removed. Covered by the multi-tenant isolation tests in `services/import.test.ts` + `routes/organiser-import.test.ts`.
- [x] `services/r2-imports.ts` — R2Service Context tag + `storeUpload` / `fetchUpload` (PR-C)
- [x] `services/revert.ts` — `revertImport` re-fetches prior CSVs from R2, re-parses, re-diffs, re-applies (PR-C)
- [x] `schemas/import.ts` — Effect Schema for `ParsedEvent`, `ParsedFamily`, `ImportPlan`, request/response shapes (PR-C)
- [x] Plan preserves `publicId` for matched families (case+whitespace-insensitive on `family_name`); only mints new IDs for brand-new families (PR-C)
- [x] Per-guest event invitations from boolean columns drive `guestEvents` rows (PR-C)
- [ ] When the source sheet adds a stable `Guest ID` column, populate `guests.externalId` from it (already in schema as of PR-A)

## Organiser portal (cire/organiser + cire/api)

- [x] Organiser auth model — resolved in the OSN merge: OSN passkey sign-in + `osnAuth()` JWT verification, no separate `organisers` table or magic link (see [[deferred]] resolved row and `[[wiki/systems/cire-auth]]` in the root OSN wiki)
- [x] Auth middleware that rejects guest sessions on organiser endpoints — `/api/organiser/*` accepts only OSN access JWTs (`osnAuth()` + ownership gates); the guest cookie is never consulted there
- [x] Organiser dashboard (`cire/organiser`) — tabbed Guests / Events view + inline import panel (2 file inputs → preview diff → apply; authenticated via OSN sign-in since the merge). History/revert UI deferred.
- [x] **CSV format explainer redesign** (`ImportPanel.tsx` `CsvFormatHelp`) — replaced the dense prose disclosure with an approachable 3-step visual guide (① Events sheet ② Guests sheet ③ Upload & preview), `open` by default, a required/optional chip legend, and a `MiniMatrix` illustrating the one-`yes`-column-per-event convention. Still a native `<details>`/`<summary>` (keyboard + SR accessible, no JS); header constants come from `lib/import-templates`.
- [x] `GET /api/organiser/events` — full event details (used by EventTable + GuestTable for human-readable event tags)
- [x] Multi-origin CORS allowlist on the API so the organiser portal (`:4322`) can call the API alongside the guest web app (`:4321`)
- [ ] Extend `OrganiserView` to display family-grouped guests with shareable publicId + password (show password only at family creation, hash thereafter — surface a "regenerate password" action)
- [ ] Organiser portal: history / revert UI (deferred from initial cut)

## Cloudflare wiring

- [ ] Replace `bun:sqlite` runtime in `cire/api/src/index.ts` with `drizzle(env.DB)` on D1
- [ ] `bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply cire-db --local` in dev script
- [ ] `bunx wrangler types` after binding changes
- [ ] **Provision R2 bucket `cire-sheets` (and `cire-sheets-preview`) before first deploy** — `bunx wrangler r2 bucket create cire-sheets`. Binding `SHEETS` is already declared in `cire/api/wrangler.toml` as of PR-A.
- [ ] Batch import respects 50ms CPU / 30s wall-time Worker limits — chunk inserts to ~100 rows; consider Durable Objects or Queues for guest lists ≥ ~500 families
