# Platform Plan — from digital invite to wedding management platform

This is the build plan for growing the cire organiser portal (`host.cireweddings.com`) from a digital-invite tool into a full wedding **management** platform: guest list, schedule, vendors (venues / photographers / decorators / caterers / …) with availability and location search, context-aware pricing estimates, budget, checklist, seating, and guest comms — with the digital invite becoming **one module among several** rather than the product itself.

Actionable checklists live in the [[platform]] TODO shard. This page holds the architecture: current-state analysis, target domain model, schema sketches, API/UI shape, phasing rationale, and open decisions.

## 1. Where we are: an invite-first domain

Today every table serves the invite (see `cire/db/src/schema.ts`):

- **`families` is the claim-code unit, not a household record.** `families.publicId` (the claim code) is `NOT NULL UNIQUE` — a household *cannot exist* without an invite credential. `codeSharedAt` / `firstOpenedAt` / `deactivatedAt` are invite-lifecycle fields living on what should be a pure guest-list record. `kind = 'host'` is a synthetic hack to let organisers preview their own invite.
- **Guests exist only via spreadsheet import.** The organiser API is read-only on guests/events (`GET .../guests`, `GET .../events`, CSV exports) plus code management; there is no direct "add a guest" or "create an event" path — the CSV import (`services/import.ts`) is the only writer.
- **`guest_events` is the real schedule-attendance truth** (which guest is expected at which event) but is treated purely as "which events render on this family's invite".
- **`rsvps` is already channel-independent** (keyed `(guestId, eventId)`, unique) — the invite is merely the only *writer* today. This is the one piece that needs no redesign.
- **`wedding_invite_customisations` is a clean presentational overlay** (1:1 with `weddings`, null = defaults) — already correctly separated.
- **`weddings` has no planning context.** No wedding date, no canonical location, no guest-count estimate, no currency/budget. (Events have `startAt`/`address`, but the *wedding* — the thing vendors are booked for and estimates are priced against — has no profile.)
- **Vendors, budget, tasks, timeline, seating: absent.** No tables, routes, services, or components. Greenfield.
- Auth is ready to grow: `weddingOwner()` / `weddingMember()` gates exist, and `wedding_hosts.role` is an enum with only `'host'` today, explicitly reserved for `editor`/`viewer` (root `wiki/TODO.md` co-host-roles item).

The refactor thesis: **promote Guests and Schedule to first-class, invite-independent modules; give the wedding a planning profile; then build the new modules (Vendors, Budget, Checklist, Seating, Comms) against those sources of truth.** RSVP data flows *up* from the invite into the same records the seating chart and caterer head-counts read from.

## 2. Target module map

```
Wedding (profile: date, location, guest estimate, currency, budget)
├── Guests      — households + guests + per-event attendance   (source of truth)
├── Schedule    — events / run-sheet                           (source of truth)
├── Invite      — claim codes, theming, RSVP *channel*         (consumer of Guests + Schedule)
├── Vendors     — CRM → directory, availability, enquiries     (consumer of profile + Schedule)
├── Budget      — categories, estimates → quotes → actuals     (consumer of Vendors + pricing engine)
├── Checklist   — planning tasks by lead time + day-of         (consumer of profile + Schedule)
├── Seating     — tables + assignments per event               (consumer of Guests + RSVPs)
├── Comms       — save-the-dates, reminders, RSVP chasing      (consumer of Guests; needs email)
└── Registry / wishing well / photos                            (later; see [[future]])
```

Modules consume each other through services, never by reaching into another module's tables from a route. Route factories stay one-per-module (existing convention), services stay `Effect.Effect<A, E>` with tagged errors, D1 via Drizzle only.

## 3. Phase 0 — core-domain refactor (invite decoupling)

Everything else builds on this. No new product surface; pure re-foundation.

### 3.1 Wedding profile

Add to `weddings`: `wedding_date` (nullable — engaged couples often don't have one yet), `location_name`, `location_lat` / `location_lng` (nullable REAL, canonical point for vendor search), `guest_count_estimate` (nullable int), `currency` (ISO 4217, default `AUD`), `budget_total_minor` (nullable int). New Settings view in the portal (name, slug, profile fields, map-pin picker for the location — manual pin first, geocoding API later, see §9). The profile drives vendor radius search, pricing estimates, and checklist lead-time seeding.

### 3.2 Households ≠ claim codes

Make `families.publicId` **nullable** (partial unique index `WHERE public_id IS NOT NULL`), and move code lifecycle semantics into the invite module:

- A household can be created with **no code**; the Guests module creates/edits households and guests directly.
- "Issue invite" (per household or bulk = the existing re-mint machinery in `services/remint-codes.ts`) mints the code — this is the moment a guest-list record acquires an invite credential.
- `sessionAuth` / `POST /api/claim` are unchanged (they already look up by `publicId`; null simply never matches).
- Alternative considered: extracting a 1:1 `family_invites` table. Cleaner conceptually, but the migration + join tax across ~10 services isn't justified when three nullable columns and a partial index express the same thing. Revisit only if invite-channel state grows (e.g. per-channel delivery tracking).
- UI language: "Households" in the Guests module; "families" stays as the table name (rename cost > benefit).

### 3.3 Direct guest + event CRUD

The import stays (it's a strength) but stops being the only writer:

- `POST/PATCH/DELETE .../guests/households`, `.../guests/households/:familyId/guests`, per-guest `PUT .../attendance` (replaces direct `guest_events` manipulation), household notes/tags.
- `POST/PATCH/DELETE .../schedule/events` with the same fields the import writes today.
- **Organiser-recorded RSVPs**: `PUT .../guests/:guestId/rsvps/:eventId` — phone/paper RSVPs land in the same `rsvps` table the invite writes to. Dietary free-text via this path needs the same Art. 9 consent capture the guest flow has (`dietaryConsentAt`) — record the organiser attestation variant (see §10).
- Import diff logic (`diffAgainstDb`) is unaffected — it already reconciles against live DB state regardless of how rows got there.

### 3.4 API + portal re-organisation

- Module routers under `/api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/{guests|schedule|invite|vendors|budget|tasks|seating|settings}`. Existing routes move in lockstep with the portal (the portal is the only client of `/api/organiser/*`; guest-site public routes are untouched). Keep a thin alias layer for one release if the deploy cadence makes lockstep risky.
- Portal IA: replace the flat `DashboardTabs` with a **module sidebar** — Overview (new home: countdown, RSVP totals, open tasks, budget snapshot), Guests, Schedule, Invite, Vendors, Budget, Checklist, Settings. Extend `lib/dashboard-route.ts` hash routing to `#/w/:weddingId/:module/:sub`. `GettingStarted` becomes the Overview's empty-state.
- Fix P-I3 (root Performance Backlog) as part of this: lift guests/events fetches to the dashboard shell so module navigation doesn't refetch.

### 3.5 Roles

Implement `wedding_hosts.role` `editor`/`viewer` + a `weddingEditor()` gate (between `weddingMember` and `weddingOwner`). Target matrix:

| Capability | viewer | editor | owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read all modules | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Write guests/schedule/invite/vendors/budget/tasks/seating | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Codes (mint/regenerate/deactivate), hosts add/remove, settings, delete wedding | — | — | ✅ |

Existing co-hosts map to `editor` (they already have import + invite-builder write via `weddingMember()` — see [[status]]). This closes the root-TODO co-host-roles item and matters doubly here: a hired *wedding planner* is exactly an `editor`.

## 4. Phase 1 — planning core (Overview, Checklist, Budget v1)

### 4.1 Checklist

```
tasks: id, wedding_id FK↘, title, notes, category (service-category enum + 'general'),
       due_at (nullable), timeframe_bucket ('12m'|'9m'|'6m'|'3m'|'1m'|'2w'|'week_of'|'day_of'),
       status ('open'|'done'|'skipped'), assignee_osn_profile_id (nullable, opaque usr_*),
       vendor_id (nullable FK, Phase 2), sort_order, created_at, completed_at
```

Seed from a versioned template (`cire/api/src/lib/checklist-template.ts`) resolved against `wedding_date` — "book your venue" lands at 12 months out, "final head-count to caterer" at 2 weeks. Re-anchoring when the date changes shifts *incomplete* seeded tasks only. Day-of tasks link to Schedule events → the day-of run-sheet view falls out of Schedule + `day_of` tasks.

### 4.2 Budget v1

```
budget_items: id, wedding_id FK↘, category (service-category enum), name,
              estimate_minor (nullable), quoted_minor (nullable), actual_minor (nullable),
              vendor_id (nullable FK, Phase 2), notes, created_at, updated_at
payments:     id, budget_item_id FK↘, label ('deposit'|'balance'|free text), amount_minor,
              due_at, paid_at (nullable), created_at
```

All money in **minor units** + the wedding's `currency` (no FX). Views: per-category rollup vs `budget_total_minor`, upcoming-payments list (feeds Overview + Checklist nudges). "Estimate" column is seeded by the pricing engine (§6) when available, hand-editable always.

### 4.3 Service-category enum

One closed enum shared by vendors, budget, tasks, and pricing — single source of truth in `cire/api/src/lib/service-categories.ts` (mirroring the pulse `shareSource` pattern; bounded-cardinality metric attribute):

`venue | catering | photography | videography | decor_styling | florals | music_entertainment | celebrant | cake | stationery | hair_makeup | transport | attire | other`

## 5. Phase 2 — Vendors & services

Two-stage: a private **vendor CRM** first (immediately useful, zero marketplace risk), then a shared **directory** with availability.

### 5.1 Vendor CRM (v1, wedding-scoped)

```
vendors: id, wedding_id FK↘, name, category (enum §4.3), contact_name, email, phone,
         website, instagram, location_name, lat/lng (nullable),
         price_min_minor / price_max_minor (nullable), quoted_minor (nullable),
         status ('researching'|'contacted'|'quoted'|'booked'|'declined'),
         available_on_date ('unknown'|'yes'|'no'|'tentative'),   -- v1 availability: a recorded fact
         notes, booked_at (nullable), created_at, updated_at
```

- Kanban-ish board by `status`, filter by category. Booking a vendor can create/attach a `budget_items` row (quoted → committed) and tick matching checklist tasks.
- `events.venue_vendor_id` (nullable FK) attaches a booked venue vendor to a Schedule event — address/maps fields can then derive from the vendor record.
- Vendor contact details are personal data (sole traders) → data-map/retention rows (§10).

### 5.2 Directory (v2, global) + availability

```
directory_vendors:     id, owner_osn_profile_id (nullable, opaque — self-serve claims),
                       name, category, description, location_name, lat, lng,
                       price_band ('$'|'$$'|'$$$'|'$$$$'), price_min/max_minor (nullable),
                       website/instagram/email/phone, listed ('draft'|'live'|'suspended'),
                       created_at, updated_at
vendor_availability:   directory_vendor_id FK↘, date (ISO day), status ('available'|'tentative'|'booked'|'blocked')
                       — PK (vendor, date); absence = unknown
wedding_vendor_links:  wedding_id FK↘, directory_vendor_id FK, saved_at
                       — organiser shortlists a directory listing; "import to CRM" copies it into `vendors`
vendor_enquiries:      id, wedding_id FK↘, directory_vendor_id FK, status ('sent'|'replied'|'quoted'|'closed'),
                       messages via a small vendor_enquiry_messages table (sender: organiser|vendor), quoted_minor (nullable)
```

- **Vendor identity = OSN accounts**, same `osnAuth()` verification cire already does for organisers — a third principal class (guest cookie / organiser JWT / vendor JWT is just an organiser JWT + `directory_vendors.owner_osn_profile_id` authz). No new auth system. OSN **orgs** may later model a vendor business with staff; opaque-id + `osn-bridge` ARC pattern as always, no cross-DB FKs.
- **Directory sourcing**: start curated (hand-seeded local listings; an admin import path), open self-serve claim/creation once moderation exists. External APIs (Google Places) only as a **live search overlay** for gaps — Places ToS forbids storing results, so it can never seed `directory_vendors` (§9).
- **Location search on D1** (no geospatial extension): index `lat`/`lng`, prefilter by bounding box computed from the wedding's canonical point + radius, order by haversine in SQL, `LIMIT` page. Fine for directory scale on the Free tier; revisit with a geohash column if listing count makes box scans hot.
- **"Available on your date"**: join `vendor_availability` on `weddings.wedding_date` in the search query; unknown ≠ unavailable (badge, not filter-out, by default).

## 6. Phase 3 — pricing estimates

Context-aware estimates from the wedding profile: guest count, date (season + weekday/weekend), location region, category, tier.

- **v1 — heuristic engine.** Pure function `services/pricing.ts` over a versioned dataset checked into the repo (`lib/pricing-baselines.ts`: per category → per-head or flat min/max in AUD by region bucket, seasonal + weekend multipliers). `GET .../budget/estimates` returns ranges + "based on N guests, {month}, {region}" provenance strings; Budget v1 seeds from it. Honest framing in UI: *estimates, not quotes*.
- **v2 — directory-informed.** Once enquiries/quotes flow (§5.2), blend in median quoted amounts by category within the search radius. Aggregate-only with a k-anonymity floor (suppress below ~5 data points) so no vendor's individual pricing is derivable.
- The dataset is content, not code — keep it a plain reviewed TS module with a `version` export logged on every estimate metric.

## 7. Phase 4 — seating, comms, registry

- **Seating**: `seating_tables` (id, wedding_id, event_id FK, name, capacity, sort_order) + `seating_assignments` (table_id, guest_id, PK pair; guest unique per event). Reads Guests + live RSVP status (badge declined/no-response guests). Drag-drop SolidJS island; CSV/print export for the venue.
- **Guest comms**: save-the-dates, "the invite is live", RSVP-chaser emails via `@shared/email` (Resend). Two prerequisites: **guest/household email columns don't exist** (new PII → consent at collection, data-map/retention/DPIA delta, §10) and **prod email is currently degraded** (`OSN_EMAIL_OPTIONAL=true`, root TODO "Re-enable email later"). Build behind the same key-optional/fail-soft pattern as Turnstile/Maps. Comms log table for auditability; unsubscribe/suppression from day one.
- **Registry / wishing well / guest photos / Wallet passes**: remain in [[future]]; registry is the first candidate after Phase 2 (root TODO "withjoy parity"). Payments (wishing well) deliberately out of scope until the platform core is proven.

## 8. Cross-cutting

- **Single Worker.** cire-api stays one Worker with module route factories (mirrors the osn-api single-Worker decision). D1 stays the store; everything cascades from `weddings`.
- **Observability**: per-module `cire.*` counters/histograms via the existing typed `metrics.ts`; category enums keep attribute cardinality bounded; no `console.*`; every `Effect.catchAll` logs.
- **Testing**: platform convention (`it.effect` + `createTestLayer()`), route tests per module factory; pricing engine is pure-function gold for table-driven tests; migration lockstep test (T-S1) becomes load-bearing with this much new DDL — pull it forward into Phase 0.
- **Free tier** (root `wiki/runbooks/free-tier-limits`): directory search is the only new read-hot path — one indexed query per search, no N+1; availability join bounded by date equality. D1 storage growth from vendors/tasks/budget is trivial next to R2 images. Watch Worker CPU on haversine ordering at scale.
- **Rate limiting**: writes ride the existing per-user limiter pattern; directory search + enquiries get their own Upstash limiters (enquiries are a spam vector).

## 9. Open decisions (tracked in [[deferred]])

| Decision | Options | Decide when |
|---|---|---|
| Vendor business identity | plain OSN account (recommended start) vs OSN **org** with staff | directory v2 self-serve opens |
| Geocoding the wedding/vendor location | manual map-pin only (recommended start) vs key-optional Geocoding API | Settings UI build |
| External discovery overlay | none (recommended start) vs Google Places live-search layer (ToS: display-only, never stored) | after directory v1 proves thin coverage |
| Pricing baseline sourcing + regions | hand-curated AU-first dataset vs licensed data | Phase 3 start |
| Guest email collection point | RSVP flow (guest-entered) vs organiser-entered vs both | Comms build; consent design first |
| Old organiser route aliases | lockstep move (recommended — portal is sole client) vs one-release alias layer | Phase 0 PR |

## 10. Compliance deltas (new PII classes)

Flag to the root compliance programme as each phase lands (root `wiki/compliance/*`):

- **Phase 0**: organiser-recorded dietary RSVPs — Art. 9 consent capture variant (organiser attests guest consent; record `consent_source`).
- **Phase 2**: vendor contact details (personal data for sole traders) → data-map + retention rows; enquiry message content.
- **Phase 3 v2**: quoted-price aggregation — k-anonymity floor documented.
- **Phase 4**: guest emails (new high-sensitivity class: contactability) → data-map, retention, DPIA delta, suppression list; comms log retention.
- Wedding lat/lng + budget figures: organiser-provided, wedding-scoped; add data-map rows, low sensitivity.

## 11. Sequencing summary

**P0 (foundation)** → **P1 (checklist + budget v1)** → **P2 (vendor CRM → directory + availability)** → **P3 (pricing v1 → v2)** → **P4 (seating, comms, registry)**.

P1 and the vendor-CRM half of P2 are independent after P0 and can run in parallel branches (disjoint tables/routes). Directory v2 and pricing v2 are the long poles — both gated on real-world content (listings, quotes), not code. Ship order optimises for *an organiser gets planning value on day one* (checklist + budget + CRM) while the two-sided directory grows underneath.

Per-phase checklists: [[platform]].
