# Drag and drop — solid-dnd, and the keyboard path we own

Drag-to-reorder in the organiser portal uses
[solid-dnd](https://github.com/thisbeyond/solid-dnd) (`@thisbeyond/solid-dnd`).
It's a purpose-built SolidJS library, so there is **no adapter layer** — the
primitives are used directly in the component.

## Why solid-dnd, and what it costs us

Three candidates were weighed (2026-07-30):

| Library | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **solid-dnd** | **Chosen.** Native Solid, ships sortable-list primitives + collision detection, ~14 kB raw / ~7 kB gzip. |
| [neodrag](https://github.com/PuruVJ/neodrag) | **Can't do the job.** It's a free-positioning *draggable* — no droppables, no collision detection, no reorder logic. Sortable lists would mean hand-writing the hit-testing and index projection. Actively maintained, but that doesn't help when the capability is absent. |
| [dnd-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit) | Works (shipped briefly), but React-only adapters meant maintaining our own Solid adapter, and at ~105 kB raw it pushed the organiser's main chunk past Vite's 500 kB warning and forced a `lazy()` code-split. |

**The known risk, stated plainly: solid-dnd's last release was 0.7.5 in November
2023 — nearly three years unmaintained.** It was adopted anyway because it is
small, has zero runtime dependencies, and is pure DOM + geometry, so there's
little for ecosystem churn to break. That reasoning is only worth anything if
it's *checked*, so `EventsEditor.reorder.test.tsx` drives a real synthetic
pointer drag end-to-end (sensor → collision detection → `onDragEnd` → commit)
rather than merely asserting that the markup renders. If a Solid upgrade breaks
the library, those tests fail. If it does become unworkable, the blast radius is
one component — the DnD wiring is not abstracted across the codebase.

## The primitives

```tsx
<DragDropProvider onDragEnd={handleDragEnd} collisionDetector={closestCenter}>
  <DragDropSensors />
  <ul>
    <SortableProvider ids={keys()}>
      <For each={rows}>{(row, i) => <Row … />}</For>
    </SortableProvider>
  </ul>
</DragDropProvider>
```

`closestCenter` is the right detector for a single-column list. Inside a row:

```tsx
const sortable = createSortable(props.row.key);
<li ref={sortable.ref} style={maybeTransformStyle(sortable.transform)}>
  <button {...sortable.dragActivators} onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}>⠿</button>
</li>
```

### `ref` + `dragActivators`, not `use:sortable`

solid-dnd's `use:sortable` directive registers the node **and** attaches the drag
activators to it **and** applies the transform — i.e. the whole row becomes the
drag affordance, which would swallow text selection and the row's own buttons.

For a **handle**, use `sortable.ref` instead and spread `sortable.dragActivators`
onto the handle. The catch: `ref` registers the node *without* applying the
transform (see `createSortable` — only the directive form sets up that effect),
so the row must apply `maybeTransformStyle(sortable.transform)` itself. Use
`maybeTransformStyle`, not `transformStyle`: it returns `{}` when there's no
transform instead of writing an identity one.

Spread `dragActivators` **before** your own `onKeyDown` — later props win in
Solid's spread, so putting it last would let a future sensor clobber the keyboard
handler.

## Accessibility — this is the part to not break

**solid-dnd has no keyboard sensor and makes no announcements.** Grepping its
bundle for `keydown`/`keyboard`/`ArrowUp` returns zero hits. (Neither does
neodrag.) Swapping ▲/▼ buttons for dragging is therefore an accessibility
*regression* unless the keyboard path is supplied by hand, so the list does three
things itself:

1. **The grip is a real `<button>`** — tabbable, and it owns an `onKeyDown` that
   moves the row on **Arrow Up / Arrow Down** (with `preventDefault()` so the page
   doesn't scroll out from under it).
2. **Focus is restored explicitly** after a move. `<For>` is keyed, so the row's
   node is *moved* rather than re-created — but a DOM move is a
   remove-then-insert and focus does not reliably survive it. Without the explicit
   `.focus()`, one keypress moves the row and then focus is on `<body>`, so the
   row can't be walked further.
3. **Every move is announced** through a polite `role="status"` live region
   ("Ceremony moved to position 2 of 3"), and each grip's `aria-label` carries its
   current position with an `aria-describedby` hint pointing at the shared
   instructions. A drag affordance is invisible to a screen-reader user otherwise.

Also required: `touch-none` (CSS `touch-action: none`) on the handle, or the
browser scrolls instead of handing the gesture to solid-dnd.

## Testing drag in happy-dom

happy-dom does no layout — every `getBoundingClientRect()` is zeroes, so
`closestCenter` sees every row's centre at (0,0) and picks a collision
arbitrarily. `EventsEditor.reorder.test.tsx` works around this by stubbing
`Element.prototype.getBoundingClientRect` to return stacked rects derived from
each row's *current* DOM position (so they stay correct after a reorder), then
dispatching `pointerdown` → `pointermove` × 2 → `pointerup`. The first move gets
past the sensor's activation threshold.

The keyboard path needs none of that and is fully deterministic — it's the
cheaper regression net of the two.

What this still can't cover: drag *feel*, the shift/settle animation, and the
grip's hover/focus styling. Those need a real browser.

## Scope + open follow-ups

Current adopters:

- **Schedule → Edit** (`EventsEditor`) — see `[[guest-event-editor]]` E7.

Still on arrow buttons:

- `ChecklistView` — tasks within a lead-time bucket, persisted via
  `tasks/reorder`. It reorders *within a bucket*, so adopting this means using
  solid-dnd's multi-container support (a `SortableProvider` per bucket), which the
  events list doesn't exercise.
