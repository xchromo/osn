# Guest + Event Editor — plan

Build plan for an interactive events + guests UI in the organiser portal that coexists with the CSV schema as an equal citizen. Expands [[platform-plan]] §3.3 (PR 5a) into a concrete design. Four requirements drive it:

1. **In-app editor** — organisers create/edit/delete events, households, guests, and per-guest attendance directly.
2. **CSV import stays** — the spreadsheet remains a first-class writer; editor and import are interchangeable.
3. **Export current state at any point** — a re-importable CSV pair in the import schema (round-trip), not just the reporting exports.
4. **Revert + pre-save checks** — every applied change (import *or* editor save) is revertable, and every write passes the same validation + impact-warning gate the import preview has today.

## 1. Current state (what exists)

- **Import pipeline** (`cire/api/src/services/{spreadsheet,import,revert,r2-imports}.ts`, routes in `routes/organiser-import.ts`): parse (RFC 4180, formula-injection guard, required columns, per-cell rules with row/column-scoped errors) → `diffAgainstDb` (name-matched reconcile, wedding-scoped through the families join, RSVP-loss warnings) → preview row in `imports` + R2 snapshot of the **uploaded** sheets → `applyImport` (FK-ordered write set, ≤50-statement D1 batches) → `revertImport` (re-applies the *previous applied import's* sheets).
- **Read surfaces**: `EventTable` / `GuestTable` (read-only rows + code management), `ImportPanel` (upload → preview diff → apply), `ImportHistory` (list + revert).
- **Reporting exports**: `guests.csv` / `events.csv` / `rsvps.csv` (`services/table-export.ts`, `rsvp-export.ts`) — dashboard-shaped headers, **not** re-importable.
- **Decided in [[platform-plan]]** (2026-07-08): direct CRUD lands (PR 5a); `source: 'import' | 'manual'` provenance on `families`/`guests`; un-invite state-loss confirm; import keeps auto-minting codes.

## 2. Gaps against the requirements

| # | Gap |
|---|---|
| G1 | No editor — the import is the only writer of events/guests. |
| G2 | Exports aren't round-trippable: headers differ from the import schema, so "export → tweak in Excel → re-import" doesn't work, and there is no way to capture "current state" as a sheet. |
| G3 | **Revert semantics break under interleaved edits.** `revertImport` re-applies the *previous import's uploaded sheets*. Once editor saves exist, reverting import N would also silently wipe every editor change made since import N−1 — and editor saves themselves would have no revert at all. |
| G4 | **Rename-safety.** `diffAgainstDb` matches by name. In a sheet that's tolerable; in an editor, renaming a household or fixing a first-name typo must NOT become remove+create (that rotates the family's claim code, drops RSVPs, and drops event images). |
| G5 | Validation lives inside the CSV parser; the editor needs the same rules without CSV framing, or the two writers drift. |

## 3. Core design — one reconcile pipeline, two front doors

Unify both writers around a **desired-state reconcile**:

```
CSV upload ──parse──▶
                      DesiredState ──▶ diff (ID-aware) ──▶ preview ──▶ apply
Editor draft ─build─▶                      │                            │
                                      warnings + plan            checkpoint (before-image)
```

- **`DesiredState`** = `{ events: DesiredEvent[], families: DesiredFamily[] }` — the existing `ParsedEvent`/`ParsedFamily` shapes (`schemas/import.ts`) extended with **optional stable ids** (`eventId`, `familyId`, `guestId`) and optional `publicId`.
- **CSV import**: `parseEventsCsv`/`parseGuestsCsv` → DesiredState (ids absent → name matching, exactly today's behaviour).
- **Editor save**: the UI accumulates edits client-side into a draft and submits the whole DesiredState (ids present for existing rows, absent for new ones).
- **`diffAgainstDb` becomes ID-aware** (fixes G4): match by id when present, fall back to normalised-name matching. A rename with an id is an *update*; the existing name-matched path is untouched. This also finally implements the long-anticipated optional `Guest ID` sheet column (`guests.externalId`, see [[spreadsheet-import]]) plus optional `Family ID` / `Event ID` columns — honoured when present, never required.
- **Apply is unchanged**: same FK-ordered write set, same chunked `db.batch` commits, same partial-apply-reconciled-by-revert tradeoff.

**Why batch reconcile instead of per-row CRUD endpoints** (amendment to [[platform-plan]] §3.3's `POST/PATCH/DELETE` sketch, needs sign-off): (a) preview-diff, impact warnings, and checkpointing fall out of the one pipeline instead of being rebuilt per endpoint; (b) one checkpoint per save session rather than per keystroke; (c) attendance-matrix edits are naturally batchy (tick 12 boxes, save once); (d) per-row CRUD can still be added later as sugar that compiles to a one-row reconcile. Everything else in §3.3 (provenance, un-invite guard, organiser-recorded RSVPs) stands — organiser RSVPs (PR 5b) stay a separate follow-up since RSVPs are deliberately outside the reconcile's blast radius (§5).

## 4. Checkpoints + revert — before-image model (fixes G3)

Generalise `imports` into a **change history**:

- **Additive migration** on `imports`: `kind: 'import' | 'editor'` (default `'import'` backfills legacy rows), `before_events_r2_key` + `before_guests_r2_key` (nullable — legacy rows lack them).
- **At apply time**, serialise the wedding's *current DB state* to the canonical snapshot CSVs (§5's serialiser) and store them as the change's **before-image** alongside the uploaded/derived after-sheets.
- **Revert change N** = run the reconcile with N's before-image as the DesiredState. This restores exactly the pre-N state regardless of what interleaved between imports and editor saves. The current "re-apply the previous import's sheets" heuristic survives only as the fallback for legacy rows without a before-image.
- **Snapshot fidelity**: the snapshot CSV is the organiser schema **plus fidelity columns** — `Family Code` (`publicId`, so a revert restores codes instead of re-minting), `Family ID` / `Guest ID` / `Event ID` (id-exact restore, rename-proof), `Source` (provenance survives the round trip). The parser accepts these as optional columns; the organiser-facing template (`import-templates.ts`) is unchanged.
- **Explicit non-goals, surfaced as preview warnings**: a revert never *restores* deleted RSVPs (cascade deletes are gone — same as today) and cannot restore an image/crop/location of an event it re-creates. Id-matched updates leave those columns untouched, so the common cases (rename, time change) are safe.
- **Retention**: snapshots are small text objects, but unbounded per-save growth needs a cap on the Free tier — prune before-images beyond the most recent **50** changes per wedding (constant, revisit with `[[free-tier-limits]]` if weddings prove chattier). The history list keeps all rows; only old R2 before-images (and thus their revertability) age out, marked in the UI.

## 5. Round-trip export (fixes G2)

- `GET .../export/events.csv` + `GET .../export/guests.csv` — current DB state in the **import template schema**: exact headers from `import-templates.ts`, one attendance column per event (truthy `x`), host families excluded, formula-sanitised via the shared `lib/csv.ts` serialiser.
- `?fidelity=full` adds the snapshot fidelity columns (§4) — the "backup my wedding" export.
- **One serialiser** (`cire/api/src/services/state-export.ts`) is used by both the export routes and the checkpoint writer, with a lockstep test against `EVENT_TEMPLATE_HEADERS`/`GUEST_TEMPLATE_FIXED_HEADERS` so export ↔ import ↔ snapshot can never drift.
- The existing reporting exports stay; UI labels disambiguate: "Guest list (re-importable)" vs "RSVP report".
- Deliberate consequence: **export → edit in Excel → import** becomes a fully supported third editing mode for free.

## 6. Pre-save checks (fixes G5)

Extract the parser's semantic rules into a shared module `cire/api/src/lib/guest-event-validation.ts`, consumed by both `spreadsheet.ts` (cell-level, with row/column error coords) and the DesiredState schema decode (field-level, with entity paths):

- **Field-level**: required Event Name / Start / Timezone; ISO-8601-with-offset timestamps; `""` end sentinel preserved; end ≥ start when both present (new rule — warn, don't reject, matching sheet leniency); palette `Name:#rgb` entries against the theme colour allow-list; http(s)-only Pinterest/Maps URLs; length bounds; non-empty household + guest names.
- **Cross-record**: duplicate event names (case/whitespace-insensitive) rejected; duplicate guest first names within a household rejected (first-name is still the fallback match key); attendance may reference only events present in the same DesiredState; empty household ⇒ warning.
- **Impact warnings** (server-computed at preview, confirm-gated — extends today's RSVP-loss warnings): deleting a guest/household/event or un-inviting a pair discards existing RSVPs (enumerate per guest, as today; add the event-delete enumeration); deleting a household kills its already-shared claim code (`codeSharedAt` known); deleting an event drops its uploaded image; a CSV import that lacks manually-added rows follows the provenance default (below).
- **Provenance default** ([[platform-plan]] decided): the diff manages `source = 'import'` rows only by default; an explicit "also remove manually-added rows" toggle widens it. Editor saves manage everything they were shown (the draft is the whole truth). "Added by hand" badge in the UI comes free.
- **Concurrency guard**: the preview response carries `baseRevision` (latest applied change id). Apply re-diffs against the live DB (today's TOCTOU defence) and additionally 409s "state changed — re-preview" when the head moved, so two co-hosts editing simultaneously get a clean conflict instead of a silent last-writer-wins.
- **Client mirror**: the organiser app re-implements the field-level rules for inline feedback (shared constants where practical); the server stays authoritative.

## 7. API surface

Gated `weddingMember()` today; flip to `weddingEditor()` when platform PR 2 (roles) lands.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST .../changes/preview` | Body: DesiredState JSON **or** `{eventsCsv, guestsCsv}` — both funnel into the one pipeline. Returns `{changeId, plan, warnings, baseRevision}`. |
| `POST .../changes/apply` | `{changeId}` — re-diff, 409 on stale `baseRevision`, checkpoint, apply. |
| `POST .../changes/revert` | `{changeId}` — before-image restore (§4). |
| `GET .../changes/list` | Paginated history (imports + editor saves), as `/import/list` today. |
| `GET .../export/{events,guests}.csv` | Round-trip export (§5), `?fidelity=full` optional. |

The existing `/import/{preview,apply,revert,list}` routes stay mounted as a **one-release alias** over the same factories (the repo's decided route-move convention), then get deleted.

## 8. Frontend (cire/organiser)

- **Draft store** (`lib/guest-event-draft.ts`): load server state → SolidJS store draft; dirty tracking; id-stable rows; client-side edit stack giving in-session undo and "discard draft" for free (no server round-trips while editing).
- **Events tab**: `EventTable` gains an edit mode — add/edit via a drawer form (name, start/end + timezone, address, dress-code description, palette editor reusing `ColorPicker`, Pinterest/Maps URLs), delete with impact confirm, re-order (writes `sortOrder`).
- **Guests tab**: household-grouped editable list — add household, add/rename guest (id-preserving), nickname, per-guest × per-event **attendance checkbox matrix**, delete guest/household.
- **Save flow**: sticky unsaved-changes bar → Save posts the draft to `changes/preview` → modal renders the plan + warnings (extract `ImportPanel`'s plan-rendering into a shared component) → confirm applies → refetch + toast. Field-invalid drafts can't be submitted; errors render inline.
- **`ImportPanel`**: flow unchanged; gains "Download current list" export buttons; the explainer notes the export/import round trip.
- **`ImportHistory` → `ChangeHistory`**: entries labelled "Spreadsheet import" / "In-app edit" with the same human summaries; Revert on any applied entry with a usable before-image.
- **IA**: build into the existing Events/Guests tabs — they are the future module homes either way; nothing here blocks on (or waits for) platform PR 3's sidebar.

## 9. Testing

- **Unit**: every validation rule + a parser-parity test (sheet path and editor path reject/accept identically); serialiser round-trip (state → CSV → parse → identical DesiredState); ID-aware diff (rename-by-id ⇒ update; no-id path byte-identical to today's plans); checkpoint prune.
- **Service**: interleaved import/editor/revert sequences restore exact before-state; publicId preserved through revert via `Family Code`; provenance filtering incl. the toggle; multi-tenant isolation mirrored from `import.test.ts`.
- **Route**: authz (guest session rejected, member accepted), 409 on stale `baseRevision`, alias routes serve both prefixes.
- **Component**: draft editing, inline validation, attendance matrix, preview modal, history revert (happy-dom harness as today).
- **D1 integration**: editor-save write sets respect the ≤50-statement chunking (extend `d1-integration.test.ts`).

## 10. PR slicing

Each PR lands green with a changeset; order matters (later PRs consume earlier machinery):

| # | PR | Contents | Schema change |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Round-trip export | Canonical serialiser + `export/*.csv` routes + UI buttons + template lockstep test | — |
| E2 | Validation + ID-aware diff | Extract `guest-event-validation.ts`; DesiredState schema; optional ID/fidelity columns in parser; diff id-matching | — |
| E3 | Change history + revert fix | `imports` additive migration (`kind`, before-keys); checkpoint-on-apply; before-image revert + legacy fallback; prune | additive |
| E4 | Provenance + changes endpoints | `source` column migration; provenance-aware diff default + toggle; `changes/{preview,apply,revert,list}` + aliases | additive |
| E5 | Guests editor UI | Draft store, household/guest editing, attendance matrix, save/preview flow | — |
| E6 | Events editor UI + history | Event drawer editing, re-order, `ChangeHistory` rebrand, explainer updates | — |

**Dependencies on platform PRs: none hard.** Platform PR 4 (code-less households) is orthogonal — until it lands, editor-created households auto-mint codes exactly like the import (consistent with the decided "import keeps auto-minting"); PR 2 (roles) just flips the gate; PR 3 (IA shell) rehomes the tabs without touching this machinery.

## 11. Open decisions (confirm before E3/E4)

1. **Amend [[platform-plan]] §3.3** endpoint shape: batch reconcile (this plan) vs per-row CRUD. Recommendation: batch reconcile, per-row sugar later.
2. **Checkpoint retention**: keep-50-before-images default, or keep-all until R2 usage proves otherwise.
3. **Revert vs manual rows**: under the before-image model, reverting an import also restores manual rows that import deleted (with the toggle) — confirm that's the wanted semantics (it is the literal "restore the previous state").
4. **Code minting for editor-created households pre-PR-4**: auto-mint (recommended) vs block manual creation until PR 4.
