 * `loginForm.style.display = "none"` from here does not just duplicate the
 * binding — it desynchronises it: Solid still believes `display` is `""`, and
 * every later attempt to restore the form is a no-op it skips. The form could
 * never be shown again for the life of the page. That is latent rather than live
 * today only because nothing sets `claimResult` back to `null`; a sign-out or a
 * rolled-back claim would surface it immediately.
 *
 * So the sequence reports the moment instead of performing it, and the island
 * flips one signal. One owner for `display`, and the choreography also gets the
 * fade it was written for: the form is still on screen while step 1 runs,
 * whereas the old arrangement had Solid hide it the instant the claim resolved —
 * a beat before this ran — leaving the fade-out animating an invisible element.
