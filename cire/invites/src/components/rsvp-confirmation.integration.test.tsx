/**
 * The seam between `RsvpModal` and `EventCard`, owned by one test.
 *
 * Both components are individually well covered, and that is exactly how the
 * bug this file exists for shipped green: `RsvpModal`'s tests know nothing of
 * `EventCard`, and both `InvitePage` packs mock `RsvpModal` and invoke
 * `onConfirmed` by hand — so the sheet in those tests is a stub that never
 * closes, and the celebration is asserted while it is still mounted. Each side
 * was correct against a contract that was jointly wrong: the cue fired at
 * reply-record time, and the whole 1400ms choreography played under a sheet
 * that stayed up for its first 900ms.
 *
 * The property that was actually violated is a relationship between two
 * components across a timer, so only a test holding both can state it:
 * **when the fill turns on, the sheet is no longer over the button.**
 *
 * That statement is what makes this more than a duplicate of the two sides. It
 * fails on a straight revert of the fix, and it also fails on a subtler change
 * neither side can see — `RsvpModal` self-closes by calling `props.onClose()`
 * directly (`RsvpModal.tsx`), deliberately bypassing `AnimatedModal`'s
 * `handleClose` and its awaited 200ms `modalExit`. Routing the self-close
 * through the animated path would look like polish and would put the sweep-in
 * back under a fading panel, with every other test in the repo still passing.
