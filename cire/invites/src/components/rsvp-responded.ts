/**
 * Timing contract for the Respond button's confirmation, played on
 * `EventCard` once a household's reply for that event is recorded (PR #380
 * shipped this choreography on the RSVP sheet's Save button instead — a
 * button that is gone by the time a guest could register it, since the sheet
 * closes itself over it. Moving it here puts the confirmation on the control
 * that is still on screen afterwards).
 *
 * The cue that starts it (`RsvpModal`'s `onConfirmed`) fires as the sheet
 * closes, not when the reply is recorded — the two are `SAVED_DWELL_MS` apart,
 * and this whole choreography outlasts that dwell. Started at record-time it
 * would play its first ~900ms under a sheet that is still covering the button,
 * so keep `TOTAL_DURATION_MS` and the dwell independent: the celebration is
 * measured from the moment the button becomes visible, not from the submit.
 *
 * Two phases, driven entirely inside `EventCard` from a single
 * `justResponded` transition (see the component for the state machine):
 *
 * 1. **Sweep-in** (0 → `SWEEP_DURATION_MS`): the button's fill sweeps from
 *    gold to `bg-bloom` left-to-right, and a tick draws into it — the same
 *    `--animate-tick-draw` keyframe `rsvp-saved.ts` used to document,
 *    unmoved in `global.css`.
 * 2. **Hold** (→ `HOLD_MS` = `TOTAL_DURATION_MS`): the filled, ticked button
 *    sits still long enough to actually read, then stays exactly as it is —
 *    there is no fade-out. The fill and the tick are both permanent once the
 *    sweep-in has played: a guest who reopens the invite tomorrow sees the
 *    same filled, ticked button a guest who just submitted settles into.
