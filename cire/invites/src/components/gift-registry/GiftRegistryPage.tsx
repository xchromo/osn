/**
 * THE GIFT LIST, as a guest reads it — the couple's list, what is still free on
 * it, and this household's own reservations.
 *
 * This is the BODY of `/<slug>/registry`, its own page since the list left the
 * foot of the invite. The page shell (`GiftRegistryDocument.astro`) owns the
 * masthead — the eyebrow and heading, which come from the invite's own public
 * copy and can therefore be server-rendered. Everything that needs the list
 * itself is here, because the list is CREDENTIALED and the server has no way to
 * fetch it: `cire_session` is host-scoped to the API origin, so the browser
 * never sends it to the guest site and the SSR render has no household to be.
 *
 * NAMING: `src/designs/registry.ts` is the invite DESIGN-PACK map and predates
 * this feature. Everything here is `gift-registry` / `GiftRegistry*` so the two
 * can never be confused, and no gift code lives under `src/designs/`.
 *
 * WHAT A GUEST MAY SEE. Counts, never names: "1 of 2 left". Who reserved what,
 * what anyone spent, and any running total belong to the couple. The API keeps
 * that (its public read never selects a claimant identity); this component's job
 * is not to undo it. The one exception is this household's OWN claim, which it
 * reads from the separate credentialed `…/registry/mine` route — their own name,
 * which they typed, echoed back to them.
 *
 * A CLAIM IS NOT A PURCHASE. It reserves, so the same pan is not offered to a
 * second household. Money — contributions to a cash fund — is a separate later
 * change; `kind: "cash_fund"` is a declared seam and renders exactly like any
 * other item here, on purpose. Inventing a contribute flow for a backend that
 * has none would be UI standing in for something that does not exist.
 *
 * THE RACE IS THE ORDINARY CASE. A shared invite link means two guests tapping
 * the last item at the same moment, and the API answers the loser 409
 * `item_fully_claimed`. That is handled honestly here — refetch the counts, say
 * what happened, leave their form open — never swallowed, and never painted as a
 * success that did not happen. There is deliberately NO optimistic update in
 * this component for exactly that reason: the counts a guest reads are always
 * ones the server just sent.
 *
 * THE PAGE IS FOR THE COUPLE'S GUESTS. A gift list names what they want and
 * what it costs, and they only ever showed it to the people they invited — so
 * the API gates the read on the same `cire_session` the rest of the invitation
 * uses, and a visitor without one is told where to enter their code rather than
 * shown the list. The gate is the API's; this component's job is to make the
 * 401 read as an invitation rather than as a failure.
