/**
 * THE GIFT LIST'S PLACE ON THE INVITE — a short band that says the couple have
 * one, shows a few of the gifts, and links to the page that holds them.
 *
 * The list itself used to render here, at the foot of the invite. It is now its
 * own route (`/<slug>/registry`) because it is the one part of an invitation a
 * guest comes back to, and coming back should not mean scrolling the whole
 * story again. What is left behind has to earn its band: a peek at the actual
 * gifts, not a bare "we have a registry" line.
 *
 * IT RENDERS NOTHING unless the read answers `ok`, and the read is CREDENTIALED:
 * the list is for the couple's guests, so a visitor who has not entered their
 * code gets a 401 and no band at all — the same silence every other section of
 * the invitation keeps behind the claim gate, rather than a band advertising a
 * list they cannot open. A 404 covers a wedding with no registry, one that is
 * not entitled, and one whose list is unpublished: one code, on purpose, so
 * nothing here can be used to tell them apart.
 *
 * THE CLAIM HAPPENS IN THE OTHER ISLAND, and it navigates nowhere — `InvitePage`
 * reveals the invitation in place. So this listens for `CLAIM_SESSION_EVENT` and
 * re-reads: without it, a guest who enters their code would have to reload
 * before the band the couple wrote appeared.
 *
 * NO COUNTS OF WHO. Same rule as the page: the availability line is quantities
 * only. Names and totals are the couple's.
