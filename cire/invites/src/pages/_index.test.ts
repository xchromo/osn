 * and `/legal-pages.test` were live routes on the guest site, and the vitest
 * they import was a 534 KB (119 KB gzip) chunk in the SSR Worker — 28% of the
 * bundle (tracker #287). A leading `_` is what excludes a file from Astro's
 * router; it stays colocated beside the `.astro` it reads, and vitest's
 * default include still picks it up.

/**
 * Drift guard for the bare-domain (`/`) route.
 *
 * Every decision this route embodies lives in two lines of Astro frontmatter,
 * and each is a one-character revert away from a real regression that nothing
 * else would catch:
 *
 *  - **302, not 301.** Where the root points is a product decision we expect to
 *    revisit; a permanent redirect would sit in browser caches indefinitely and
 *    could not be recalled.
 *  - **The destination is `MARKETING_URL`**, not a literal — so the resolution
 *    rule (and its fallback for an empty/relative/non-http value) actually
 *    applies. A hardcoded URL here would bypass `resolveMarketingUrl` entirely.
 *  - **No query string is forwarded.** The only query that ever rode the bare
 *    domain was a `?code=` host-preview deep link — a claim credential.
 *    Reinstating `${Astro.url.search}` would deposit it in the marketing site's
 *    access logs and `Referer` chain.
 *
 * The route renders nothing, so there is no DOM to assert against and no Astro
 * test harness in this workspace. A source-text guard is the cheapest thing
 * that can actually fail when the contract is reverted — the same approach
 * `src/styles/gold-text-token.test.ts` takes over `.astro` files here.
