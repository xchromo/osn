/**
 * Guest-side client for the gift registry.
 *
 * NAMING: everything this feature adds to the guest site carries the
 * `gift-registry` / `GiftRegistry*` prefix. `src/designs/registry.ts` is the
 * invite DESIGN-PACK map and predates this module — an unrelated use of the
 * word. Nothing here may be called `Registry*`, and no gift code belongs under
 * `src/designs/`.
 *
 * Two properties this module exists to keep:
 *
 *  1. **Every credentialed call passes `credentials: "include"`.** `cire_session`
 *     is HttpOnly and host-scoped to the API ORIGIN, which is a different origin
 *     from the guest site. A cross-origin `fetch` on the default `same-origin`
 *     mode drops the cookie silently — no error, just no session, and the call
 *     reads as "signed out" forever.
 *  2. **Failures are values, not throws, and they are told apart.** The 409
 *     "someone else took the last one" race is the ORDINARY case here, not an
 *     edge: two guests tapping the last item at the same moment is what a shared
 *     invite link produces. It must reach the caller as its own result so the UI
 *     can refetch the counts and say what happened, rather than being swallowed
 *     into a generic "something went wrong" — or worse, optimistically reported
 *     as a success.
