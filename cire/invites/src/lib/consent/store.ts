/**
 * The shared, page-wide consent state.
 *
 * Module-level signals rather than a Solid context, on purpose. The guest site
 * is a set of independent Astro islands — the invite page, the header, and (in
 * future) a banner mounted straight into the document shell are separate
 * hydration roots with no common Solid parent, so there is no single tree a
 * provider could sit at the top of. A module singleton is the thing every
 * island genuinely shares. It also preserves the one behaviour the old
 * Pinterest gate got right: granting consent in one place flips every gated
 * embed on the page in the same tick, with no plumbing.
 *
 * ## Hydration rule
 *
 * `record()` starts `null` (= "no decision") and is only populated in
 * {@link hydrateConsent}, which callers run from `onMount`. That is what keeps
 * the server-rendered markup and the first client render identical: both sit at
 * the required-only floor, and third-party content appears a tick later once
 * the cookie has been read. Seeding the signal at module scope instead would
 * produce different HTML on server and client and risk Solid mis-patching the
 * hydrated tree.
 *
 * Note the floor — not the opt-out defaults — is what applies during that tick,
 * even though optional categories are on by default. `record() === null` means
 * two different things depending on whether hydration has run ("we haven't
 * looked yet" vs "we looked, and there's nothing"), and only the second may
 * resolve to the permissive defaults. {@link isCategoryGranted} is where that
 * distinction is enforced.
