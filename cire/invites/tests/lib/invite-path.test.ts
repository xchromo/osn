 * The invitation is now linked TO, not only landed on: the gift list has its own
 * page and every way back from it — the sticky rail, the signed-out prompt, the
 * closed-list note — is this string. A slug is organiser input, so it is encoded
 * for the same reason the API encodes one it puts in a URL: unencoded, `../../src/`
 * climbs out of the wedding and `?`/`#` truncate the path, and the way home
 * silently goes somewhere else.
