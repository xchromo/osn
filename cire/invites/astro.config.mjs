/**
 * `motion` (plus its `motion-dom`/`motion-utils` deps) is ~187 KB raw of dead
 * weight in the SSR Worker build (tracker #287). The three `.motion.ts`
 * modules that import it — `components/Modal.motion.ts`,
 * `designs/gala/UnlockReveal.motion.ts`, `designs/classic/UnlockReveal.motion.ts`
 * — are only ever reached from a SolidJS `onMount` prefetch hint or a DOM
 * event handler (modal open/close, the post-claim reveal), both of which are
 * client-only and never run while the server renders HTML. But Vite's SSR
 * build still walks and chunks every module reachable via `import()`,
 * dynamic imports included, so the whole library ships in `dist/server` with
 * nothing there ever calling it.
 *
 * Stub `motion` out of the SSR module graph only. The client build (this
 * plugin only intercepts `options.ssr` resolutions) still resolves the real
 * package, so both design packs keep animating exactly as before — verify
 * with a client build + `dist/client` inspection after touching this.
