# CLAUDE.md

AI coding assistant reference. For full spec see README.md. Work is tracked in GitHub Issues under `label:product:cire` — product work in `xchromo/osn`, findings in the private `xchromo/osn-tracker`.

## Quick Context

Cire is a bespoke digital wedding invite — Astro + SolidJS frontends with a Cloudflare Workers backend (Elysia + D1 + Drizzle), designed to feel tactile and animated. It lives inside the **OSN monorepo** as the `cire/` workspace (merged from cire.git, 2026-06). Packages: `cire/invites` (guest site, `invite.cire.localhost`), `cire/host` (organiser portal, `host.cire.localhost`), `cire/api` (backend, `api.cire.localhost`), `cire/db` (Drizzle schema + D1 migrations). Dev hostnames come from portless — see the root `CLAUDE.md` > Local URLs. All paths in this file are relative to the OSN repo root.

Auth is a **two-system model** (see `[[wiki/systems/cire-auth]]` in the OSN wiki): guests claim a family code (`POST /api/claim` → hashed-at-rest `cire_session` cookie, `sessionAuth()` on `/api/rsvp` — no OSN account); organisers sign in with their **OSN passkey** on the portal, and `cire/api` verifies the OSN access JWT via `osnAuth()` (`@shared/osn-auth-client`) plus a per-`:weddingId` **three-tier role gate** on `/api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/*`: `weddingOwner()` (owner-only — codes, settings, REMOVING/demoting a co-host, delete), `weddingEditor()` (owner or `editor` co-host — module writes, the RSVP-by date, and ADDING a co-host; viewers get 403 `read_only_role`), `weddingMember()` (any role incl. read-only `viewer` — reads + invite preview). Roles live in `wedding_hosts.role` (list + create are `osnAuth()`-only; owner = caller). The interim `X-Organiser-Token` shared secret is gone. Organisers can host **multiple** weddings — the portal lands on a wedding list/selector and a create form.

## File Responsibilities

- `README.md` → Human-readable spec, architecture, stack
- `CLAUDE.md` → AI reference — patterns, conventions, commands
- `../wiki/TODO.md` → A pointer to GitHub Issues. Nothing is tracked in the wiki
- `../wiki/` → the one Obsidian vault for the whole monorepo. Cire's own vault at
  `cire/wiki/` folded into it on 2026-08-21; cire pages carry a `cire-` prefix where a
  bare name would collide (`cire-vendors`, `cire-platform-plan`, `cire-invite-builder`)

## Where Cire Work Is Tracked

GitHub Issues, filtered to `label:product:cire`. The per-area `cire/wiki/todo/` shards were retired in the 2026-08-15 migration; every open item from them is an issue. Cire's `deferred` and `future` shards now live in `[[wiki/deferred-decisions]]`.

```bash
gh issue list --repo xchromo/osn --state open --label product:cire
gh issue list --repo xchromo/osn-tracker --state open --label product:cire
gh issue create --repo xchromo/osn --type Feature --label product:cire --title "..."
```

Product work — guest site, organiser portal, API, schema, the platform build-out — goes to the public `xchromo/osn`. Every security, performance and compliance finding goes to the private `xchromo/osn-tracker`, whatever its severity: `xchromo/osn` is public and a finding names an unpatched route. Full label and type rules are in the root `CLAUDE.md` §Where Work Is Tracked.

### Querying the Wiki

With Obsidian: open the repo-root `wiki/` as a vault, use graph view and search.

Without Obsidian (CLI):

```bash
# Find every cire page
rg "tags:.*cire" ../wiki/ --glob "*.md"

# Find all pages linking to a topic
rg "\[\[cire-vendors\]\]" ../wiki/

# Open work (issues, not files)
gh issue list --repo xchromo/osn --state open --label product:cire

# Open findings
gh issue list --repo xchromo/osn-tracker --state open --label product:cire
```

### Wiki Maintenance Rules

1. **New system = new wiki page** — adding a service, integration, or tool? Create a wiki page for it.
2. **Modify pattern = update wiki page** — changing a convention, flow, or architecture? Update the relevant wiki page.
3. **Frontmatter required** — every wiki page must have `title`, `tags`, `related`, `last-reviewed` in YAML frontmatter.
4. **Use `[[wiki links]]`** — all internal cross-references use Obsidian wiki link syntax.
5. **Update `last-reviewed`** — set to today's date when you modify a wiki page.

## Current State

Flat sibling-package layout under the OSN repo root (no `apps/` / `packages/` nesting — that was the standalone-repo layout, pre-merge):

```
cire/                 # workspace dir inside the OSN monorepo
├── invites/          # @cire/invites — Astro + SolidJS guest site (invite.cire.localhost)
├── host/             # @cire/host — Astro + SolidJS organiser portal (host.cire.localhost)
├── vendor/           # @cire/vendor — Astro + SolidJS vendor portal (vendor.cire.localhost)
├── api/              # @cire/api — Elysia on CF Workers (api.cire.localhost)
├── db/               # @cire/db — Drizzle schema + D1 migrations
├── theme/            # @cire/theme — zero-dep shared theming validators (CSS-colour allow-list)
├── README.md
└── CLAUDE.md         # this file
```

Every cire doc lives in the repo-root vault now — start at `[[wiki/apps/cire]]`, which lists the folded pages, then `[[wiki/systems/cire-auth]]` for the auth contract.

## Tech (one-liner)

TypeScript, Bun, Cloudflare Workers + Pages, Astro + SolidJS + Motion One, Elysia, Effect (backend + DB only), D1 + Drizzle, two-system auth (guest claim-code sessions + organiser OSN passkeys via `@shared/osn-auth-client`), Vitest, oxlint + oxfmt, lefthook, GitHub Actions

## Conventions

OSN monorepo conventions apply since the merge (root `CLAUDE.md` is authoritative); the cire-specific deltas from the standalone era that survive are listed under Key Patterns below.

- Branch: PRs required to merge to main; always work on a `feat/*` branch (osn convention — the old "merge directly, no PR review" solo rule no longer applies)
- Changesets: **required** for every PR (`bun run changeset`) — CI fails without one; package names must match workspace `name` exactly (`"@cire/api"`, not `"cire"`)
- Commits: SSH-signed; descriptive messages
- Hooks: root lefthook runs oxlint + oxfmt on staged files pre-commit, type check pre-push
- Package manager: `bun` — always use `bun run`, `bunx --bun`, `bun add`
- Monorepo: bun workspaces; scope commands with `--cwd cire/invites` or `--cwd cire/api` (from the OSN repo root)
- Cloudflare bindings (D1, R2, KV) are typed via `wrangler types` — regenerate after schema or binding changes
- **Observability** (see `[[wiki/observability/cire-workerd]]` for what cire does differently, `[[wiki/observability/overview]]` for the platform guide):
  - No `console.*` in backend — use Effect structured logger (`Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.logWarning`, `Effect.logError`)
  - Log levels: debug (local only), info (happy path), warning (recoverable), error (unrecoverable)
  - Never log PII (email, tokens, passwords, passphrase values)
  - Redaction deny-list: `password`, `passphrase`, `token`, `email`, `sessionId`, `passwordHash`
  - Always log error paths — every `catch` / `Effect.catchAll` must emit a log line

## Testing Patterns

```typescript
// Vitest — unit test (service layer)
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { generateClaimCode } from "../services/claims";

describe("generateClaimCode", () => {
  it("produces an unguessable code matching expected format", () => {
    const code = generateClaimCode();
    expect(code).toMatch(/^[A-Z]+-[A-Z0-9]{4}$/);
  });
});
```

```typescript
// bun:test — Elysia route integration test
import { describe, it, expect } from "bun:test";
import { createApp } from "../app";
import { createDb, seedDb } from "../db/setup";

const db = createDb(":memory:");
seedDb(db);
const app = createApp(db);

describe("POST /api/claim", () => {
  it("returns 401 for an unknown claim code", async () => {
    const res = await app.fetch(
      new Request("http://localhost/api/claim", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({ publicId: "FAKE-XYZ-0000" }),
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      }),
    );
    expect(res.status).toBe(401);
  });
});
```

- Test files live alongside source: `*.test.ts` co-located with the module
- **`*.browser.test.tsx` runs in a real Chromium**, not jsdom — for anything needing computed CSS, layout, paint/stacking order, sticky behaviour or media emulation. Opt-in (`bun run --cwd {cire/invites,cire/host} test:browser`), its own CI step. **`@cire/host` has one too** (added 2026-08-06) — its ink tokens are translucent and it ships two ramps, so what a token measures as authored and what it measures as painted are different numbers. jsdom parses no stylesheet and reports zeroed rects, so a class-contract assertion in the fast tier and a measurement in the browser tier are complements, not duplicates. See `[[wiki/conventions/browser-tests]]`
- Run tests: `bun run test` (all workspaces, turbo) or `bun run --cwd cire/api test`
- Integration tests use a local D1 instance via `wrangler dev` — do not mock the database
- Note: platform convention elsewhere in the monorepo is `it.effect` + `createTestLayer()` — cire alignment is tracked as an open issue in `xchromo/osn`

## Key Patterns

### Backend (Elysia on CF Workers + Effect)

- Routes in `cire/api/src/routes/` — one route factory per domain (claim, rsvp, organiser, import), composed by `createApp` in `src/app.ts`
- `createApp` uses `aot: false` — Elysia's AOT compiles handlers via `new Function`, which CF Workers forbids
- Middleware in `cire/api/src/middleware/` are Elysia plugins (scoped `derive` + `onBeforeHandle`) — `auth.ts` (`sessionAuth`, guest cookie), `osn-auth.ts` (`osnAuth`, organiser JWT via the shared Elysia adapter), the per-`:weddingId` role gates `wedding-owner.ts` / `wedding-editor.ts` / `wedding-member.ts` (owner-only vs editor-write vs any-role-read — pick the gate by the roles matrix in the root wiki's `[[wiki/systems/cire-auth]]`), `rate-limit.ts`, `turnstile.ts`. (An `ownedWedding` "single owned wedding" middleware existed pre-multi-wedding; it was removed once organisers could own several weddings.)
- POST routes pass a sentinel `parse` hook (`{ parse: () => ({}) }`) and read `request.json()` by hand, so malformed JSON degrades to the schema's 400 instead of a framework parse error
- Business logic in `cire/api/src/services/` — routes delegate to services, no logic in handlers
- Services return `Effect.Effect<A, E>` — use `Effect.runPromise` / `Effect.runSync` in route handlers to unwrap
- Error types are tagged classes extending `Data.TaggedError` — no thrown exceptions in service layer
- D1 access via Drizzle only — no raw SQL string construction
- Cloudflare env bindings typed from `wrangler types` output (`worker-configuration.d.ts`)
- Effect is backend + DB only — never import it in `cire/invites` or `cire/host`

### Frontend (Astro + SolidJS)

- Astro pages in `cire/invites/src/pages/` (and `cire/host/src/pages/`) — `.astro` files for static shells
- SolidJS islands for interactive components — `client:load` or `client:visible` as appropriate
- Page-level transitions: Astro View Transitions API
- Component-level animations: `@motionone/solid`
- Keep animation logic in `*.motion.ts` files co-located with components
- **Tailwind class names must be literal source text.** The scanner reads source as text, so a computed class (`` `grid-cols-${n}` ``, or any concatenation) emits **no CSS at all** — silently, since an unknown class is simply ignored. Where a layout constant has to exist in JS too (e.g. a key handler stepping by a grid's column count), keep the literal at the usage site, export the constant, and add a static drift guard in the tests asserting they agree — the pattern `SECTION_MENU_COLUMNS` (`invite/InviteBuilder.tsx`) and the `auto-grid` / `page-frame` utilities use
- **`createMemo` runs its computation eagerly**, unlike a plain accessor — so a memo declared above the `const` it reads throws a TDZ error at component-init, not on first read. Order memos below their dependencies
- **A `transform` on ANY ancestor makes `position: fixed` resolve against that ancestor, not the viewport — and makes it a stacking context no `z-index` can escape.** Motion One's reveal (`UnlockReveal.motion.ts`) leaves its final inline `transform` on the events `<section>` and every `[data-event-card]`, so anything fixed mounted inside them is doubly trapped: mispositioned (measured 723–814px down the page instead of at the viewport edge — off-screen on a phone) and painted below page-level overlays. This is what left the RSVP save toast behind the `z-100` sheet it fires underneath; the fix is to mount page-level overlays at the component ROOT, as siblings of the modals, not inside an animated section. When testing this, do NOT reach for `document.elementFromPoint`: `solid-toast`'s container is deliberately `pointer-events: none`, so it hit-tests as transparent even when painted perfectly. Assert the mechanism — no fixed-position containing block between the element and `<body>`, and a computed `z-index` above `Z_LAYER.MODAL`
- **Motion One leaves its final keyframe as INLINE STYLE, and Solid will not clean it up.** A fade-out that ends at `opacity: 0` leaves `opacity: 0` on the element forever. Invisible while the element never returns — and a blank-screen bug the moment something brings it back, because Solid's style binding on that node typically owns only `display`, so it happily restores `display` onto a fully transparent box. Whenever you add a path that RE-SHOWS what an animation hid, clear what that animation wrote (`el.style.opacity = ""`, `el.style.transform = ""`). Writing those two is safe where writing `display` is not, precisely because Solid does not manage them — there is no binding to desynchronise. The unit tier cannot see this: jsdom computes no styles, and those tests mock `UnlockReveal.motion` and `motion` away, so the animation causing it never runs. Assert it in the browser tier with `checkVisibility({ checkOpacity: true, checkVisibilityCSS: true })` — `display` alone was never the failure. (Found on the guest sign-out control: the restored claim form sat at `opacity: 0` in both design packs with 800 unit tests green.)
- **Write an animation's inline END state when it FINISHES, never before it starts — and hide what it will fade in before the container can paint.** Motion reverts to base styles on finish, which is why the reveal keeps an inline end state; writing that `opacity: 1` up front instead paints one full-brightness frame that the animation's first keyframe then drops back to zero, so the guest sees the content blink in, vanish, and fade in again. A staggered child is worse: nothing hides it (only its container carries `opacity-0`), so a `startDelay` leaves every child at full opacity from the moment the container appears until Motion commits its first frame. Hide the children inline first, run the animations, and settle the inline end state in a `finally` so a stalled or throwing step can never leave them invisible. One frame is invisible to jsdom AND to the browser test tier's assertions-after-the-fact — catch it by sampling `getComputedStyle` per `requestAnimationFrame` in a real browser (`UnlockReveal.motion.ts`, both packs)
- **Anything a choreography animates must be IN THE DOM before it runs.** The post-claim components are `lazy`, so on a cold cache their chunk is still in flight when the claim resolves, `<Suspense fallback={null}>` renders no cards, and the reveal animates an empty section and finds nothing to stagger — the cards then slam into the layout at full opacity when the chunk lands. `awaitEventCards` (`components/await-event-cards.ts`) is the fix: the sequence awaits it through the `waitForEvents` hook, UNDER the fade-out of the step before it rather than on top of it, and both halves of the wait are capped so a chunk that never arrives still reveals the invite
- **A `position: sticky` box resolves its `bottom` offset against the SCROLLPORT, not against its parent's content box** — so the usual "cancel the container's padding with a negative margin" trick inverts on a sticky element: a negative bottom margin *hoists it up* over the content instead of stretching it down into the padding. A full-bleed sticky action bar must instead have the scroll container drop its own bottom padding and let the bar own the edge (plus its `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`) — the `flushBottom` prop on `AnimatedModal`, used by `RsvpModal`. Layout bugs of this shape are invisible to the test tier (jsdom/happy-dom compute no layout), so pin the class contract in tests and measure the real thing in a browser
