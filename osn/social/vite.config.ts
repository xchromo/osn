/**
 * AZ-P-I1. `/authorize` is a cold cross-origin landing: the browser arrives
 * from the relying party with no warm connection to the OSN issuer, so
 * `GET /authorize/context` pays DNS + TCP + TLS before a byte moves. A
 * `preconnect` overlaps that handshake with the JS parse instead.
 *
 * The origin comes from `VITE_OSN_ISSUER_URL`, the same build input the
 * client uses, so a per-environment issuer can never be preconnected to the
 * wrong host. `crossorigin` is required: the context read is
 * `credentials: "include"`, and a preconnect opened in the wrong CORS mode is
 * a second connection rather than a reused one.
 *
 * The value is read off the resolved config rather than `process.env`, so it
 * sees exactly what the app's `import.meta.env` will — `.env` files included.
 * A malformed or missing URL emits no tag rather than a dead one.
