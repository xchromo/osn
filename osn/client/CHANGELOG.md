# @osn/client

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 8732b5a: Audit and update dependencies across all workspaces: align version drift (typescript, vitest, solid-js), bump minor versions (drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit, @effect/vitest, @effect/opentelemetry, OTel exporters, @solidjs/router), and apply patches (@astrojs/solid-js, @astrojs/check).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 97f35e5: Add shared in-app sign-in and registration across the OSN stack.

  **`@osn/core`** — new first-party `/login/*` endpoints that return a
  `Session + PublicUser` directly, mirroring the existing `/register/*`
  flow with no PKCE round-trip:

  - `POST /login/passkey/{begin,complete}`
  - `POST /login/otp/{begin,complete}` (enumeration-safe: `begin` always
    returns `{ sent: true }`)
  - `POST /login/magic/{begin}` + `GET /login/magic/verify?token=…`

  Service layer refactored to extract `verifyPasskeyAssertion`,
  `verifyOtpCode`, and `consumeMagicToken` helpers so the direct-session
  variants (`completePasskeyLoginDirect`, `completeOtpDirect`,
  `verifyMagicDirect`) share verification logic with the existing
  code-issuing variants. The hosted `/authorize` HTML + PKCE path is
  unchanged and remains the third-party OAuth entry point.

  **`@osn/client`** — new `createLoginClient({ issuerUrl })` factory
  mirroring `createRegistrationClient`, with `passkeyBegin/Complete`,
  `otpBegin/Complete`, `magicBegin/Verify` methods. Throws `LoginError`
  on non-2xx. Returned sessions are already parsed via `parseTokenResponse`
  and ready to pass to `AuthProvider.adoptSession`.

  **`@osn/ui`** — new shared SolidJS components under `@osn/ui/auth`:

  - `<Register />` — migrated from `@pulse/app` with a new `client` prop
    so it's decoupled from any specific app's env config.
  - `<SignIn />` — new three-tab sign-in (passkey / OTP / magic) driving
    the new `/login/*` endpoints through an injected `LoginClient`. Auto-
    falls-back to OTP when WebAuthn is unsupported.
  - `<MagicLinkHandler />` — invisible root-level component that exchanges
    a `?token=…` query param for a session and clears the URL.

  Package now pulls in the SolidJS + Vitest + @simplewebauthn/browser
  devDeps it needs to actually host these components.

  **`@pulse/app`** — replaces the old `useAuth().login()` redirect to
  `/authorize` with an in-app `<SignIn />` modal. Imports `<Register>`,
  `<SignIn>`, and `<MagicLinkHandler>` from `@osn/ui/auth/*`; shared
  `RegistrationClient` and `LoginClient` instances live in
  `src/lib/authClients.ts` and are injected as props.

### Patch Changes

- 97f35e5: Restructure the monorepo by domain. Top-level directories are now `osn/`, `pulse/`, and `shared/`, with matching workspace prefixes (`@osn/*`, `@pulse/*`, `@shared/*`). Key renames:

  - `@osn/osn` (apps/osn) → `@osn/app` (osn/app)
  - `@osn/pulse` (apps/pulse) → `@pulse/app` (pulse/app)
  - `@osn/api` (packages/api) → `@pulse/api` (pulse/api) — this package has always been Pulse's events server, the `@osn/` prefix was misleading
  - `@utils/db` → `@shared/db-utils`
  - `@osn/typescript-config` → `@shared/typescript-config`

  `@osn/core` remains unchanged as the OSN identity library consumed by `@osn/app`. The prefix rule going forward: `@osn/*` = identity stack, `@pulse/*` = events stack, `@shared/*` = cross-cutting utilities.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cf57969: Add an email-verified registration flow end-to-end with passkey enrolment, plus a security redesign that addresses the critical findings raised during review.

  **`@osn/core` — new endpoints + service work**

  - `POST /register/begin` — validates email + handle, normalises email to lowercase, generates an unbiased 6-digit OTP via rejection sampling, stores a pending registration in a bounded (10k cap), swept-on-insert in-memory map, and emails the OTP. Always returns `{ sent: true }` regardless of conflict to remove the user-enumeration oracle (S-M1/S-M26). Refuses to overwrite a non-expired pending entry to prevent griefing of in-progress registrations (S-M2/S-M23).
  - `POST /register/complete` — verifies the OTP using a constant-time comparison (S-M4/S-M25), enforces a 5-attempts-then-wipe brute-force cap (S-H1 partial), inserts the user using the DB unique constraint as the source of truth (no TOCTOU; the pending entry is only deleted after a successful insert — S-H4/S-H10), and returns access + refresh tokens **directly** alongside a single-use enrollment token. The registration code path no longer touches `/token` so it does not depend on the pre-existing PKCE bypass at `/token` (tracked separately as S-H4/S-H9).
  - New `issueEnrollmentToken` / `verifyEnrollmentToken` service helpers — short-lived (5 min) JWTs of `type: "passkey-enroll"`, single-use via an in-memory consumed-jti set with opportunistic sweep.
  - `POST /passkey/register/{begin,complete}` now accept an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header where the token is either an enrollment token or a normal access token; the token's `sub` is compared against the body `userId` and a mismatch returns `401` (S-C1/S-H5 partial). The legacy unauth'd path is preserved with a deprecation warning so the hosted `/authorize` HTML page still works; removing it is tracked in the security backlog.
  - New `publicError()` route helper maps Effect-tagged errors to opaque public payloads (`invalid_request`, `internal_error`) and logs the underlying cause server-side (S-H5/S-M6/S-M4).
  - Dev-only `console.log` of OTP codes is now gated on `NODE_ENV !== "production"` (S-M3/S-M22).

  **`@osn/client` — RegistrationClient redesign**

  - `createRegistrationClient` exposes `checkHandle`, `beginRegistration`, `completeRegistration`, `passkeyRegisterBegin`, `passkeyRegisterComplete`. **`exchangeAuthCode` is gone** — `completeRegistration` now returns a parsed `Session` ready for `AuthProvider.adoptSession` plus an `enrollmentToken`. Both passkey calls accept the enrollment token and send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  - New `OsnAuth.setSession` + Solid `AuthProvider.adoptSession` for installing a session obtained out-of-band by the registration flow.

  **`@osn/pulse` — Register component**

  - Multi-step UI: details (email + handle + display name with debounced live availability check) → 6-digit OTP → optional passkey enrolment → done.
  - `adoptSession` is called immediately after OTP verification, **before** any passkey work — the user is signed in regardless of whether they go on to set up a passkey, so a flaky WebAuthn ceremony or an unsupported environment can no longer leave them stranded.
  - WebAuthn feature-detection via `browserSupportsWebAuthn()`; the passkey step is skipped entirely (and the UI jumps straight to "done") on environments without WebAuthn — currently Tauri's iOS webview, until we ship the native plugin.
  - Imperative skip path replacing the previous `createEffect` (P-I10), inlined `detailsValid` accessor (P-I11), module-scope `RegistrationClient` (P-I12).
  - Wired into `EventList` as a "Create account" button next to "Sign in with OSN".

  **Test coverage** (277 tests total, +58 from the previous PR baseline)

  - Service-level: happy path, lowercase normalisation, no-row-before-verify, ValidationError on bad inputs, enumeration-resistant begin, refuse-to-overwrite pending entry, wrong OTP, no-pending error, single-use replay, brute-force attempt cap, TOCTOU loss against legacy `/register`, enrollment token issue/verify/consume, replay rejection, type-claim discrimination.
  - Route-level: complete shape assertions, enumeration-resistant 200 responses, complete-without-begin, replay attack, reserved handle availability, Authorization gating with valid enrollment token / valid access token / mismatched sub / invalid bearer / legacy unauth'd path, enrollment-token consumption on `/complete`.
  - Client unit tests: URL composition, body shapes, Authorization header propagation, RegistrationError on non-OK, trailing-slash issuerUrl normalisation.
  - Solid `AuthProvider.adoptSession` round-trip test (real provider, harness component, asserts both `useAuth().session()` reactivity and `localStorage` persistence).
  - Pulse Register component test: input sanitisation, debounced availability with stale-result guard, `detailsValid` gating during `checking`, OTP digit-only clamp, immediate `adoptSession` after OTP, happy passkey enrolment with enrollment token propagation, "Skip for now" → done, WebAuthn-unsupported jump-to-done, Cancel.
