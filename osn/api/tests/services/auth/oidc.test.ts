/**
 * S-L3 (`xchromo/osn-tracker#441`). `clientNameSkeleton` folds each character through
 * `CONFUSABLE_FOLD` via `Object.hasOwn`, not the `in` operator — `in` walks
 * the prototype chain, so a name containing a character that only exists as
 * an *inherited* `Object.prototype` property would have folded through that
 * inherited value instead of being left alone and dropped.
 *
 * There is no such collision under normal `Object.prototype` (its own member
 * names are multi-character, and this fold runs one code point at a time), so
 * the test pollutes the prototype itself with a single-character property to
 * prove the guard checks OWN membership rather than trusting on that absence.
