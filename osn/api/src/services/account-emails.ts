/**
 * Profile → account-address lookup, for the internal ARC route only.
 *
 * The caller is cire-api's retention sweep: when a wedding's guest data reaches
 * the end of its retained year, cire deletes the per-gift detail and mails the
 * couple the aggregate it kept. cire stores the owning OSN PROFILE id
 * (`weddings.owner_osn_profile_id`, `usr_*`) and no address of its own, so the
 * address has to come from here.
 *
 * The lookup takes profile ids and does the users→accounts join internally, so
 * no `acc_*` id ever crosses the boundary (`wiki/compliance/gdpr.md`: the
 * account id never leaves the auth boundary). It answers with a bare array of
 * the pairs it CAN answer for, and says nothing at all about the rest:
 *
 *   - profile id unknown            → omitted
 *   - account soft-deleted (S-H4)   → omitted
 *   - joined row has no address     → omitted
 *
 * All three look identical to the caller, so the route is not an enumeration
 * oracle for "does this profile exist". That indistinguishability is the whole
 * reason this is an omit-list rather than a per-id `{ found: false }`.
