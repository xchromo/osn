/**
 * The dashboard must not reach a Node builtin.
 *
 * This test reads source text rather than importing anything, which is unusual
 * and deliberate: the property under test belongs to the module graph as Vite
 * builds it for a browser, and no runtime available here can observe it. Vitest
 * runs on node (`tools/metrics/vitest.config.ts`), where `import "node:fs"`
 * simply succeeds — so a test that imported `Dashboard.tsx` and asserted it
 * rendered would have passed against the very bug this guards.
 *
 * What actually happens in the browser: Vite replaces `node:fs` with a stub
 * that throws on first property access, the throw lands during module
 * evaluation before `render()` is reached, and the page stays blank with no
 * failure reported anywhere but the console.
 *
 * It follows imports rather than listing files, because the leak that prompted
 * it was one hop past anything the dashboard names: `shape.ts` imports
 * `report.ts`, and `report.ts` statically imported `index.ts`. A guard that
 * only checked the file in the stack trace would have stayed green.
 *
 * Only *static* imports are walked, and that is the point rather than a gap:
 * they are exactly the set evaluated when a module loads. `require()` and
 * dynamic `import()` are the escape hatch — `report.ts` reaches `node:fs` and
 * `index.ts` through both, on purpose, inside the functions that need them.
