/**
 * Write cards for pull requests that merged before cards existed.
 *
 * Two things make a backfill different from a live run, and both shape this
 * file:
 *
 * **The branch is usually gone.** A merged branch is deleted, so
 * `git diff base...head` has nothing to resolve locally. The file list comes
 * from the GitHub API instead (`repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:n/files`), which
 * returns per-file additions and deletions and does not care that the ref no
 * longer exists.
 *
 * **The rating is not trustworthy the same way.** A card backfilled today is
 * describing work whose cost is already known, so any rating attached to it now
 * has seen the answer. `rate-complexity` handles that by marking a backfilled
 * rating `complexity:unconfirmed`; this script simply transcribes whatever the
 * issue carries and never invents one. Cards it writes are `phase: "at-merge"`.
 *
 * The spend still comes from local transcripts, so a backfill only reaches as
 * far back as `~/.claude/projects` on this machine, and only for branches this
 * machine did the work on. Pull requests it cannot cost are reported and
 * skipped rather than written as zero — a card claiming a PR cost nothing is
 * worse than no card, because a query cannot tell it from a cheap one.
