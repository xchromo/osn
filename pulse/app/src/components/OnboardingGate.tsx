 * First-run gate. While a session exists, fetch onboarding status. If the
 * account hasn't completed onboarding (and the user hasn't already chosen
 * to skip this session), redirect to `/welcome`. Anonymous browsers are
 * unaffected — Pulse's public discovery surface stays open.
 *
 * The gate is keyed on the access token so a profile switch (which
 * issues a new token) re-runs the check; switching to a profile whose
 * account already onboarded is a cache hit and resolves instantly.
 *
 * Lives in its own module (rather than inline in `App.tsx`) so the
 * redirect logic — the only seam between this feature and every other
 * route — has direct unit-test coverage.
