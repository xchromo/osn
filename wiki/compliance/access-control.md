# Access Control

SOC 2 CC6 demands a documented, reviewed, least-privilege access posture.
This is the matrix.

## End-user authentication (in-product)

Already strong; documented elsewhere.

| Surface | Mechanism | Page |
|---|---|---|
| Account login | Passkey-primary (WebAuthn `userVerification: "required"`) | [[passkey-primary]] |
| API access | ES256 access tokens, 5 min TTL, JWKS-verified. Carries `osn_sid`, a one-way per-profile binding to the session it was minted from, so a cookieless caller can still name its own session on the paths that revoke all the others | [[identity-model]], [[sessions]] |
| Sensitive ops | Step-up tokens (`aud: "osn-step-up"`, single-use JTI) | [[step-up]] |
| Recovery | 64-bit single-use codes (Copenhagen Book M2) | [[recovery-codes]] |
| Service-to-service | ARC tokens (ES256, scoped, kid-pinned, revocable, scope-validated on cache hit). **Scope reach can widen without the scope name changing — review the routes a scope gates, not just the grant list.** Current `graph:read` reach for `@cire/api`: handle→profile resolution, batch profile displays, global handle prefix search, **and viewer-scoped connection search** (added 2026-08-02 for co-host autocomplete; no new scope was minted). The last of these carries a caller invariant osn-api cannot enforce — the `profileId` must be the calling service's own authenticated end user, never a client-supplied value — see [[cire-auth]]. | [[arc-tokens]] |
| Org admin (Zap M3) | Role-gated `org_agents.role = "admin"` | [[zap]] |
| Cire organiser | OSN access token (`aud: "osn-access"`) verified via `@shared/osn-auth-client`, then per-wedding **role authz** — three tiers: `weddingOwner()` (owner: code management, delete, and the SUBTRACTIVE half of host management — removing a co-host, changing a co-host's role), `weddingEditor()` (owner or `editor` co-host: module writes — import, invite, locations — **and ADDING a co-host**; viewers get 403 `read_only_role`) — including `PUT /settings`, which the middleware alone cannot decide: the settings body is owner-only EXCEPT the RSVP-by deadline (`rsvpDeadline` + `rsvpDeadlineTimezone`), so the handler applies a **field-level owner check** on top of the gate and refuses a non-owner patch carrying any other key with 403 `owner_only_fields` (logged + counted on `cire.wedding.settings.owner_only_refused`; the allow-list is derived from the request schema's own field list, so a new setting is owner-only by default). Every settings write records its author in `weddings.updated_by_osn_profile_id` (migration 0056) — the panel has two principal classes now, so a change to a guest-facing control is attributable. A deadline may not be set in the PAST by anyone, owner included: a backdated date locks the invite for every guest the instant it lands (400 `rsvp_deadline_in_past`), `weddingMember()` (any role incl. `viewer`: reads + invite preview). Roles live in `wedding_hosts.role` (`editor`/`viewer`), checked per-request from the DB (demotion is immediate, never embedded in the JWT). **An `editor` may create a seat; only the owner may change a role or revoke one** (2026-08-01) — the grant boundary is additive-versus-subtractive, not owner-versus-co-host. `editor` is the ceiling anyone can grant (the owner is never rowed into `wedding_hosts`), seats are capped per wedding so the owner's list can never truncate below the real count, and `wedding_hosts.added_by_osn_profile_id` is surfaced in the panel so a seat the owner did not create is visible as such. | [[cire-auth]] |
| Cire guest | **Guest-session credential class** — family claim code (`families.public_id`) → opaque 256-bit `cire_session` (SHA-256 at rest), family-scoped, gates `/api/rsvp` only. Never an OSN account. | [[cire-auth]] |
| Cire vendor (sole-trader) | **Vendor principal class** — OSN account holder + organization membership (per `org:read` ARC scope grant). `vendorOrgMember()` middleware gate (fail-closed: missing/failed check → 403, never bypass) protects `/api/vendor/*` listing writes and claim consumption. Scope `org:read` requested by cire-api, granted by osn-api's ARC allowlist; resolved at claim/consume time via ARC verification of the requestor's org membership. | [[cire-auth]] |
| Cire organiser address lookup | **ARC scope `account:email-read`** — gates `POST /internal/accounts/emails` on osn-api and nothing else. Deliberately not folded into `graph:read`: an email address is the one field the graph routes never return, so the grant can be withdrawn on its own without taking co-host autocomplete down with it. Sole intended holder: `@cire/api`, whose retention sweep has to reach a couple whose gift detail it is about to delete and stores no address of its own. Returns account email addresses, capped at 100 profile ids per call, as an omit-list — an unknown id, a soft-deleted account and an address-less account are indistinguishable, so the route is not an existence oracle. **Known limitation (S-M2):** `PERMITTED_SCOPES` in `graph-internal.ts` is one flat allowlist governing what `/graph/internal/register-service` will grant to any service, so nothing on the registration side binds this scope to cire-api. The restriction is enforced at the point of use instead — the handler checks the signature-verified `iss` against `cire-api` and 401s anything else. Making the registration allowlist per-service is the outstanding fix. | [[arc-tokens]], [[retention]] |

## Production console access (the SOC 2 gap)

The matrix that needs to exist, by environment + system + role.

| System | Role | Granted to | MFA required? | Granted via | Reviewed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub `xchromo` org | Owner | <named human> | ✓ Hardware key | Per-PR review | Quarterly |
| GitHub `xchromo` org | Maintainer | <named humans> | ✓ Hardware key | Per-PR review | Quarterly |
| GitHub `xchromo` org | Read | <named humans> | ✓ Any TOTP / WebAuthn | Manual | Quarterly |
| Production database | Read-write (operator) | <named humans> | ✓ Via Tailscale + WebAuthn | Manual + audit log | Quarterly |
| Production database | Read-only (debugging) | <named humans> | ✓ | Same | Quarterly |
| Grafana Cloud | Admin | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Quarterly |
| Grafana Cloud | Editor | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Quarterly |
| Grafana Cloud | Viewer | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Quarterly |
| Cloudflare | Super admin | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Quarterly |
| Cloudflare | Domain admin | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Quarterly |
| Cire Cloudflare D1 (guest DB) | Read-write (operator) | <named humans> | ✓ Via Cloudflare dashboard / Wrangler + WebAuthn | Manual + audit log | Quarterly |
| Cire Cloudflare R2 (`cire-sheets`, raw guest CSVs) | Read-write (operator) | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual + audit log | Quarterly |
| Domain registrar | Owner | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Annual |
| Stripe platform Dashboard (cire gift registry — first live use once the PR #760/#762 keys are set; Pulse ticketing later). Dashboard access reaches every couple's connected-account view and the API/webhook secrets below | Admin | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Quarterly |
| Email provider (Resend today; Cloudflare Email Service is the legacy fallback) | Admin | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Quarterly |
| Redis provider (Upstash, `ap-southeast-2`) | Admin | <named humans> | ✓ | Manual | Quarterly |

This page is the template; the matrix with named humans lives in
a private successor under `wiki/compliance/access-matrix/<YYYY>-<Q>.md`
on a quarterly cadence and is **never committed publicly**. The public
template gives auditors the structure; the private quarterly file gives
them the evidence.

## Worker secrets — Stripe (`cire-api-production`)

Two Cloudflare Workers secrets gate the cire gift-payment surface. Both
are **unset today on every tier**, so the code (PR #760, stacked PR #762)
ships inert; setting either is gated by the paperwork checklist in
[[subprocessors]] §"Stripe Connect (cire) — the paperwork gate". They are
secrets, never `[vars]`: the API key can move money, and the signing
secret is the only thing that stops anyone else's webhook body being
believed.

| Secret | What it gates | Provisioned | Rotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Unset ⇒ the organiser Connect routes are **not mounted** (no payment surface, not a broken one). The portal does **not** probe for this: the Money-gifts panel renders either way and surfaces the 404 as a toast, so an unset key is visible to a couple only when they press Connect (C-L1). Set ⇒ account creation, onboarding links, live account reads — calls that act on the platform's Stripe account. | `bunx wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY --env production`, then `wrangler deploy --env production` (a secret change does not cycle warm isolates). Requires Cloudflare access per the matrix above + Stripe Dashboard access to mint the key. Live key on production only; the dev tier gets a test-mode key (`sk_test_…`) or nothing. | Roll the key in the Stripe Dashboard (Developers → API keys) with an expiry window, `wrangler secret put` the new value, redeploy, let the old key expire. Immediate revocation (suspected compromise): roll with no window — the Worker 502s Stripe calls until the new value is deployed, which is the correct failure. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Unset ⇒ `POST /api/stripe/webhook` **does not exist**. Nothing else authenticates that endpoint — the signature IS the authentication — so without a signing secret it must not be reachable. | Same `wrangler secret put` + redeploy path. The value comes from the Dashboard webhook endpoint (created in checklist step 6). | **Zero-downtime by design, worth writing down:** when a secret is rolled in the Dashboard with an overlap window, Stripe signs each delivery with BOTH secrets, and the verifier (`cire/api/src/services/stripe.ts`) checks every `v1` digest in the header against its one configured secret — so deliveries verify throughout, whichever value the Worker holds. Sequence: roll in the Dashboard with an overlap window → `wrangler secret put` the new value → redeploy → old secret expires. |

## Access lifecycle

### Granting

Pre-conditions to meet before we grant any production access:

1. Documented role per the matrix above (no "founder gets everything by default").
2. WebAuthn / hardware key enrolled on the system.
3. Acknowledged the security policy + this page (signature recorded).
4. PR opened modifying the quarterly matrix file.

### Reviewing

Quarterly cadence, calendar-driven:

1. Pull each system's user list.
2. Diff against last quarter's matrix.
3. Confirm each user still requires the access (manager attestation).
4. Revoke unused (>90 d) accounts unless attested.
5. Commit the new quarterly matrix file.
6. Note exceptions in `wiki/compliance/access-reviews/<YYYY>-<Q>.md` (public — the review record, not the contents).

### Revoking

Triggers:

1. Departure (immediate; same-day SLA).
2. Role change reducing scope (within 7 days).
3. Inactivity >90 d unless attested.
4. Suspected compromise (immediate; rotate keys).

Revocation checklist per leaver:

- [ ] GitHub org member removed
- [ ] All personal access tokens / OAuth apps revoked
- [ ] Cloudflare account removed
- [ ] Grafana Cloud user removed
- [ ] Database direct-access credential rotated (everyone, not just leaver)
- [ ] SSH keys removed from any bastion
- [ ] Tailscale node removed
- [ ] Slack / comms removed
- [ ] WebAuthn / step-up tokens for any in-product admin role revoked
- [ ] Calendar review: any `wiki/compliance/access-matrix/...` updates needed before next quarter

## Internal admin actions on user data

When an operator queries or modifies production user data, the action
must be:

1. **Necessary** — for support, security, or legal reasons; not curiosity.
2. **Logged** — to a tamper-evident audit log (planned: `admin_actions` table with append-only constraint + Grafana log mirror).
3. **Attributable** — keyed to the operator's account, not a shared service account.
4. **Reviewable** — quarterly sample by a second reviewer.

This is informal today; the `admin_actions` table is on the backlog.
ID: **C-M16**.

## Service-account hygiene (ARC)

ARC tokens are S2S only; no human ever holds one. Rotation is automatic
(see [[arc-tokens]]). Per service account:

- One private key ever in use; rotated every 24 h with overlap window.
- Public keys distributed via JWKS or `service_account_keys` table.
- `allowedScopes` enforced at issuer + verifier sides.
- Revocation via `evictPublicKeyCacheEntry(kid)` is immediate (resolves S-H100).

## Cire access expectations

Cire's guest DB (Cloudflare D1) and `cire-sheets` R2 bucket hold guest PII
including special-category dietary free-text (see [[data-map]]). They are a
**separate** data store from `osn/db`, so operator access is a distinct
grant in the matrix above. Expectations:

- **No standing access.** Operators query cire D1 / R2 only for support,
  security, or a manual DSAR (cire has no DSAR endpoint yet — see [[dsar]]
  C-M1); each access is necessary, logged, attributable, and reviewable per
  "Internal admin actions on user data" above.
- **Guest claim codes are credentials.** `families.public_id` is treated as
  a secret (redacted in logs, C-M2), not a public identifier — do not paste
  codes into tickets or logs.
- **The wedding owner is not an operator.** Organiser access to their own
  wedding is in-product authz (OSN JWT → the `weddingOwner()` /
  `weddingEditor()` / `weddingMember()` role gates), not console access; it
  grants no visibility into other weddings.
- **Co-host roles are least-privilege in-product grants.** A wedding's owner —
  **or, since 2026-08-01, an `editor` co-host** — may seat other OSN accounts as
  `editor` (module writes) or `viewer` (read-only) co-hosts
  (`wedding_hosts.role`). Only the OWNER may change a role or revoke a seat, and
  an unknown/corrupted stored role degrades to `viewer`, never upward. Three
  controls bound the widened grant: `editor` is the ceiling anyone can grant, so
  no seat outranks its creator; seats are capped per wedding below the list's
  read ceiling, so the owner's view of who holds access can never silently
  truncate; and each row records `added_by_osn_profile_id`, surfaced in the
  panel, so an owner can see which seats they did not create. **Residual, and
  accepted rather than solved:** a new seat is live immediately and the owner is
  not notified — tracked as `S-M2` in `xchromo/osn-tracker`. See the
  roles capability matrix in [[cire-auth]].

## Project changes required

Tracked with `C-` IDs:

1. **Quarterly access matrix** — first cycle: 2026-Q3. ID: **C-M5** (also in [[soc2]]).
2. **Quarterly access review** — first cycle: 2026-Q3. ID: **C-L3**.
3. **`admin_actions` audit log** — append-only constraint + Grafana mirror. ID: **C-M16**.
4. **GitHub org hardening** — required hardware-key MFA, signed commits, branch protection, codeowners on prod paths. ID: **C-L4**.
5. **Tailscale or equivalent bastion** — for direct DB access; no public DB endpoint. ID: **C-L21** (decision: bastion vs read-replica vs CLI proxy).
6. **Departure runbook** — checklist above formalised. ID: **C-L22**.
