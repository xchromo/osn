# Security Fixes — Completed

Archived completed security findings from [[TODO]]. Finding IDs follow the [[review-findings]] format. For open findings see the Security Backlog in [[TODO]].

## TODO-backlog hardening sweep (2026-07-05)

- **S-H (arc-scope-pattern)** — **Issue:** `@shared/crypto` `SCOPE_PATTERN` (`/^[a-z0-9_:]+$/`) rejected hyphens while the deployed scope taxonomy contains hyphenated scopes (`step-up:verify`, `app-enrollment:write` in osn-api's `PERMITTED_SCOPES`). Every `signArcToken`/`createArcToken` call carrying them threw `ArcTokenError: Invalid scope format` at mint time — so the entire Flow B leave-Pulse fan-out (`pulse/api/src/lib/osn-bridge.ts` step-up verify + enrollment-leave calls) was broken at runtime and had never worked. **Why:** availability failure of a compliance-critical path (C-H2 account erasure); latent because tests mock the HTTP layer above token minting. **Solution:** pattern widened to `/^[a-z0-9_:-]+$/`; round-trip regression test signs + verifies the full hyphenated taxonomy (`shared/crypto/tests/jwk-sign.test.ts`). Found while adding `graph:resolve-account` (below). **Rationale:** the server-side `PERMITTED_SCOPES` allowlist is the authoritative scope registry; the format validator must admit everything it grants. See [[arc-tokens]].
- **S-M1 (pulse-onboarding)** — **Issue:** `GET /graph/internal/profile-account` (profileId → accountId) was gated by the generic `graph:read` scope, so any ARC consumer of the internal graph API could enumerate the mapping and dissolve the multi-account privacy invariant ([[identity-model]] §"Privacy Rules"). **Solution:** dedicated `graph:resolve-account` scope — added to `PERMITTED_SCOPES`, required on the endpoint, granted to pulse-api (boot self-registration, rotation, and the `@osn/db` seed all send `graph:read,graph:resolve-account`) and requested per-call by `graphBridge.getAccountIdForProfile` and cire-api's account-link resolver. A `graph:read`-only token now 401s (regression test). **Ops note:** cire-api's stable key is pre-registered in prod with `graph:read` only — re-run the registration curl with the widened scopes before the next account-link attempt ([[production-deploy]] §6). **Rationale:** least privilege wants the constraint declarative, not an emergent property of who happens to hold keys. See [[pulse-onboarding]], [[cire-auth]], [[arc-tokens]].
- **S-L6 (account-deletion)** — **Issue:** Pulse's `requireArc` returned bare 401s from its early-exit branches (missing/malformed token, kid unknown, kid revoked, key-registration expired, registry scope denial) with no metric, so ARC failures on Pulse were indistinguishable on dashboards; only tokens reaching `verifyArcToken` were counted. **Solution:** each early exit now records the shared `arc.token.verification{iss, result}` counter (`malformed` / `unknown_issuer` / `revoked_key` / `scope_denied`); `revoked_key` is a new bounded member of `ArcVerifyResult` in `@shared/observability`. `verifyArcToken`'s own reporting is untouched, so no double-count. **Rationale:** mirrors osn-api's verification observability. See [[observability/overview]], [[arc-tokens]].
- **S-M4 (auth)** — **Issue:** no startup assertion that `OSN_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` imports as a signing key; the public JWK pasted into the private slot imports fine (verify-only usages) and every token mint then fails at request time. **Solution:** `loadJwtKeyPair` throws at boot when `!privateKey.usages.includes("sign")`; unit-tested with the public-JWK-in-private-slot fixture. **Rationale:** misconfiguration should fail at deploy, not on the first login.
- **S-L5 (auth)** — **Issue:** a non-local deploy missing `OSN_ORIGIN` silently fell back to the `http://localhost:5173` WebAuthn origin — fails closed (all passkey ceremonies rejected) but with no boot-time signal. **Solution:** `buildAppDeps` now throws when `OSN_ENV` is non-local and `OSN_ORIGIN` is unset, mirroring `assertCorsOriginsConfigured`; every deployed wrangler tier already sets the var. See [[passkey-primary]].
- **M3 (Copenhagen)** — `EmailSchema` now rejects emails longer than 255 chars (practical RFC 5321 mailbox ceiling) ahead of the format regex; boundary-tested at 255/256.

## Code-quality review sweep (2026-07-03)

- **S-M5 (osn)** — **Issue:** the account-erasure routes (`DELETE /account`, `POST /account/restore`, `GET /account/deletion-status`) keyed their per-IP limiters via the deprecated no-args `getClientIp(headers)` — left-most `X-Forwarded-For` hop (attacker-controlled) with an `"unknown"` shared-bucket fallback — while every sibling auth/profile route had already moved to the S-M34 trust policy. **Why:** a spoofed XFF chooses the rate-limit bucket, so the per-IP ceilings on a destructive surface (account deletion) could be bypassed or used to starve the shared `"unknown"` bucket. **Solution:** `createAccountErasureRoutes` now takes `clientIpConfig` (threaded from `app.ts` like profile/auth), resolves the socket peer per request, keys via `getClientIp(headers, { ...clientIpConfig, socketIp })`, and denies un-attributable requests (`isUnresolvedIp` → 429) instead of pooling them; behaviour pinned by new route tests (`osn/api/tests/routes/account-erasure.test.ts`). **Rationale:** brings the last per-IP limiter in `osn/api` onto the same `cf-connecting-ip`-trusting path as the rest of the deployed Worker — see [[rate-limiting]].
- **IB-S-L1 (cire, #152)** — **Issue:** the CSS-colour allow-list (the CSS-injection gate for organiser theming) existed as two byte-identical copies — `cire/api/src/schemas/invite.ts` (write-time) and `cire/web/src/components/dress-code-render.ts` (render-time) — with no shared source; a drifted edit on either side could let an un-validated value reach guest-facing inline `style`. **Why:** duplicated security gates fail by divergence, not by bugs in the original. **Solution:** the validator now lives once in the new zero-dependency `@cire/theme` package (`isSafeCssColor`); both former sites import it and re-export their old names (`isThemeColor`, `isValidColor`) so call sites and tests are untouched. **Rationale:** a security invariant enforced on both sides of a trust boundary must have exactly one definition — see [[cire]].

## Performance-audit sweep, in-branch review round (2026-07-03)

Findings raised by the branch's own security review against code introduced by the same branch — fixed before merge, so no deployed exposure existed.

- **S-M1 (ics-cache)** — **Issue:** the new ICS caching headers used `Cache-Control: private, max-age=300`; a browser's private cache keys on URL only, so a 200 fetched by an authorized viewer could be replayed for 5 minutes across auth-state changes (logout, profile switch) on the same client without re-running the `loadVisibleEvent` gate — and the ICS body includes private-event GEO metadata. **Why:** client-side bypass window around a server-side access gate (OWASP A01). **Solution:** `Cache-Control: private, no-cache` + the weak ETag — every reuse is a conditional revalidation through the visibility gate (cheap 304, body regeneration still skipped). **Rationale:** keeps the entire P-I14 perf win while making the cached body unservable to a viewer the server would reject. See [[event-access]].
- **S-L3 (rsvp-event-hint)** — **Issue:** `listRsvps`/`rsvpCounts` accepted a pre-loaded `event` row (P-W1/P-I15 optimisation) without asserting `event.id === eventId`, so a future mis-paired caller would apply one event's authorization to another event's RSVP rows. **Solution:** the hint is honoured only when it names the same event; on mismatch the services silently re-load the correct row. **Rationale:** O(1) guard converts route-level discipline into a service-enforced invariant. See [[event-access]].
- **S-L2 (dev-otp-env)** — **Issue:** `IS_LOCAL_ENV` was frozen at module evaluation; a runtime populating `process.env` after module load would permanently treat the process as local and emit dev-OTP debug lines (`to=<email> code=<otp>`). **Solution:** lazy resolution cached on first `logDevOtp` call (mid-request, after env population), keeping the P-I1 single-read win; "unset ⇒ local" stays consistent with `isNonLocal` in `index.ts`. **Rationale:** removes the eval-timing hazard without diverging from the codebase-wide env convention or breaking local dev. See [[email]].
- **S-L1 (recovery-timing-comment)** — **Issue:** the S-M2 comment on `consumeRecoveryCode` claimed the unknown-identifier and wrong-code branches do "the same shape of work", overstating timing parity after the atomic-UPDATE rewrite (the known branch adds lockout-store round-trips and a classification SELECT). **Solution:** comment corrected to state parity is approximate and bounded by the per-IP rate limit + per-account lockout; residual oracle pre-dates the branch. **Rationale:** documentation must not overstate a security property. See [[recovery-codes]].

## Dependency security sweep — `bun audit` 8→0 + audit-gate retighten (2026-06-21, #214)

- **S-L1 (deps-audit)** — **Cleared every `bun audit` advisory and removed the last pre-push `--ignore` flags.** **Issue:** `bun audit` reported 8 advisories (2 high, 5 moderate, 1 low), and the pre-push gate in `lefthook.yml` carried two standing `--ignore` entries (`GHSA-96hv-2xvq-fx4p` ws DoS, `GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff` vite `server.fs.deny` bypass) accepting them as dev/test-only. **Why:** even though only one advisory reached a deployed Worker, standing ignores erode the gate — a new advisory in the same package would be silently accepted. **Solution (#214):** fixed all at source rather than ignoring. The single runtime-reaching one — `@opentelemetry/core` <2.8.0 (`GHSA-8988-4f7v-96qf`, unbounded alloc in W3C Baggage propagation, imported by `@shared/observability` in every deployed API Worker) — fixed by bumping the OTel SDKs to 2.8.0 / exporters 0.219 **plus** a root override `"@opentelemetry/core": "^2.8.0"` (forces the patched core through `@effect/opentelemetry`, which otherwise pins 2.6.1). The dev/build/test-only ones fixed via root `overrides`: `ws ^8.21.0` (high), `vite ^7.3.5` (high — 7.3.5 patches `server.fs.deny`, which also cleared the `launch-editor` moderate), `yaml ^2.9.0`, `js-yaml ^4.2.0`, `@babel/core ^7.29.7` (low). **Rationale:** an override on the transitive package is the right tool when a direct parent pins a vulnerable version; patching beats ignoring. With every advisory gone, the two `--ignore` flags were dropped — the gate is back to a clean `bun audit --audit-level=high` with **zero** ignores. **Result:** `bun audit` → *No vulnerabilities found*; full `check` (19/19) + `test` (22/22) green. **Deferred (documented, not security-blocking):** `cropperjs` 1→2 (later shipped, #215) and `vite` 7→8 (blocked by Astro 6 pinning vite 7 — see [[TODO]] Deferred Decisions for the re-eval trigger). `oxlint` 1.70 bump (#216) was split out separately. `bun.lock` is shared, so dependency PRs can conflict on reinstall.

## Transitive-dependency high advisories — Astro SSRF + undici TLS bypass (2026-06-19, #dep-security-bumps)

- **S-H (astro-ssrf)** `GHSA-2pvr-wf23-7pc7` — **Astro: Host header SSRF in prerendered error page fetch.** **Issue:** `astro` was pinned `^6.4.2` (resolving to `6.4.4`) across all three Astro packages — `@cire/web`, `@cire/organiser`, `@osn/landing` — and the advisory covers `astro <6.4.6`: the prerendered-error-page fetch did not validate request origin against `allowedDomains`, so a crafted `Host` header could drive a server-side request to an attacker-chosen origin. Bundled with the moderate `GHSA-jrpj-wcv7-9fh9` (XSS via unescaped attribute names in spread props). **Why:** `high`-severity un-ignored advisory on three first-party packages, two of which (`@cire/web`, `@cire/organiser`) are deployed and serve guest/organiser traffic on `cireweddings.com`; it was blocking **every** push because the pre-push `bun audit --audit-level=high` gate in `lefthook.yml` does not (and should not) ignore it. **Solution:** bumped the direct `astro` dependency to `^6.4.6` in `cire/web/package.json`, `cire/organiser/package.json`, and `osn/landing/package.json` (lockfile resolves to `6.4.6`, the lowest patched release; 6.4.6 hardens `addAttribute` and validates request origin against `allowedDomains` before fetching prerendered error pages). 6.4.5→6.4.6 carries no breaking config/adapter changes (Astro changelog: bug-fixes + security hardening only). **Rationale:** these are direct deps, so the minimal correct fix is bumping the version range to the lowest patched line — no override needed; kept consistent across all three packages. Verified: `bun run build`, `bun run --cwd cire/web build`, `--cwd cire/organiser build`, `--cwd osn/landing build` all build cleanly on 6.4.6; full test/lint/fmt suite green.
- **S-H (undici-tls)** `GHSA-vmh5-mc38-953g` — **undici: TLS certificate validation bypass via dropped `requestTls` in SOCKS5 `ProxyAgent`.** **Issue:** `undici` resolved to two vulnerable copies in range `>=7.23.0 <7.28.0` — `7.27.2` (via `jsdom@29` in `@cire/web` tests) and `7.24.8` (pinned by `miniflare@4` in `@cire/api`). Bundled with moderate `GHSA-pr7r-676h-xcf6` (cross-user info disclosure via shared-cache whitespace bypass). **Why:** `high`-severity un-ignored transitive advisory — blocking every push at the same audit gate. **Solution:** the direct parents can't move minimally — `miniflare@4.20260603.0` **pins** `undici` to exactly `7.24.8`, so bumping it isn't possible without a miniflare major. Used the narrowest root `overrides` entry instead: `"undici": "^7.28.0"` in the root `package.json` (lockfile collapses both copies to `7.28.0`, the lowest patched release, staying in the 7.x line both parents expect). **Rationale:** bun honours `overrides`; an override on the transitive package is the correct tool when the direct parent pins a vulnerable version. Narrow `^7.28.0` constraint avoids force-pushing a major. undici is test/build-tooling-only (jsdom + miniflare test runtimes) — never on a deployed Worker path — but the fix is free and clears the gate. **Result:** both high advisories gone from `bun audit`; the pre-push gate (`bun audit --audit-level=high` with the existing 4 ignores) now exits 0. Remaining `bun audit` findings (vite, ws, yaml, @babel/core, @opentelemetry/core, js-yaml) are separate, pre-existing, and out of scope — none is a new regression. Note: `bun.lock` is shared, so this may conflict with other open PRs that reinstall.

## osn-api rate-limit + IP-trust hardening behind Cloudflare (2026-06-18, #153)

- **S-M34 (osn wiring) + the auth-429 bug** — Behind Cloudflare, osn-api was still resolving the rate-limit keying IP from the left-most `X-Forwarded-For` hop. **Issue:** Cloudflare itself sets XFF, but an attacker upstream of CF could pollute it; in practice legitimate users were also being lumped into shared buckets, surfacing as spurious auth 429s. **Why:** a spoofable per-IP key is both a limiter bypass (attacker rotates a forged header) and a self-inflicted DoS (real users collide). **Solution:** the deployed Worker now keys on `cf-connecting-ip` **exclusively** (`trustCloudflare: true`, set per non-local tier in `osn/api/src/index.ts` `buildAll` → `build-deps.ts` `clientIpConfig`); unresolved IPs **deny (429)** rather than bucket. Separately, the 25 60s-window per-IP **auth** limiters moved off Upstash onto **native Workers rate-limit bindings** (`RL_AUTH_IP_*`) — a global, atomic edge limiter — while Upstash keeps the 1h-window IP limiters + all per-user/account limiters + the stateful auth stores. Workers observability (`[observability]`) enabled on osn-api. **Rationale:** `cf-connecting-ip` is the only client IP an upstream can't forge once traffic is fronted by Cloudflare; native bindings give cluster-global counters without a Redis round-trip on the hottest path. See [[rate-limiting]], [[redis]], [[free-tier-limits]]. **Residual (open):** `osn/api/src/routes/account-erasure.ts` (~L61) still uses the deprecated no-args `getClientIp` — tracked as **S-M5 (osn)** in the Security Backlog. New low/info notes also logged: **S-L7 (osn)** native-binding `namespace_id` collision check, **S-L8 (osn)** `head_sampling_rate = 1` cost.

## Scripts extraction — db:reset path guard (2026-06-16)

- **S-L2 (db-dev-tooling)** — The per-package `db:reset` scripts (`osn/db`, `pulse/db`, `zap/db`, and the root reset that chains them) ran `rm -f` against a path taken from `*_DATABASE_URL` env vars with no validation. **Issue:** an env var (or a stray `.env`) pointing `OSN_DATABASE_URL` at a real file outside the local-sqlite default (`../../data/*.db`) would have been wiped without a prompt. Dev-only tooling, operator-supplied, never bundled into deployed code — so bounded, not attacker-reachable. **Why:** an unbounded developer footgun; the wrong pattern to leave lying around for copy-paste. **Solution:** the three inline scripts were consolidated into `scripts/db-reset.sh`, which now refuses to delete anything that isn't a `*.db` file resolving **inside** the repo root (exits 1 with a clear message otherwise); an absent parent dir is a no-op rather than an error. Covered behaviourally by the prep-pr review and the script's arg-guards. **Rationale:** repo-containment is stronger than the originally-suggested refuse-if-absolute-path check (absolute paths inside the repo stay valid) while still blocking the dangerous "redirect at a real file" case. See `scripts/db-reset.sh`.

## Cire Hono → Elysia migration (2026-06-12)

- **S-M1 (cire-elysia)** — `createApp`'s `onError` hook only mapped `NOT_FOUND`; every other error fell through to Elysia's dynamic-mode default renderer, which puts `error.message` in the response body. **Issue:** unhandled defects (e.g. D1 errors surfacing through `dbQuery`'s `Effect.promise`) returned internals like `no such table: families` to callers — empirically reproduced on the pre-auth `/api/claim` endpoint. A regression vs Hono, whose default returned a generic 500. **Why:** information disclosure on a pre-auth surface — D1 error strings and Effect causes aid schema reconnaissance. **Solution:** the `onError` hook now catches all non-`NOT_FOUND` codes, logs `{ code, message }` via the Effect structured logger, and returns a generic `{ error: "Internal error" }` 500. Regression test drops the `families` table and asserts the generic body. **Rationale:** one choke point restores the generic-500 contract instead of chasing per-route `catchAllDefect` gaps; the log line preserves operability. See [[cire-auth]].
- **S-L1 (cire-elysia)** — `@elysiajs/cors` scheme-strips configured origin strings that lack `://`, so a schemeless `WEB_ORIGIN` entry (e.g. `cire.example.com`) would have allowlisted **both** `http://` and `https://` variants for credentialed CORS — where the old hand-rolled Hono `Set.has(origin)` check failed closed — and would also have silently disabled the session cookie's `Secure` flag (`webOrigin.startsWith("https://")`). **Issue:** configuration-dependent widening of the credentialed-CORS allowlist. **Why:** credentialed CORS for an `http://` origin lets a network-position attacker drive authenticated cross-origin requests. **Solution:** the Worker entry now fails closed (503 `Worker misconfigured`) on any `WEB_ORIGIN` entry that is not `https://` or `http://localhost`. **Rationale:** restores the fail-closed property the Hono implementation had for free, at the same edge-validation choke point that already guards missing bindings. See [[cire-auth]].

## Pulse Tauri CSP allowlist (2026-04-25)

- **S-L3** — `pulse/app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` shipped with `app.security.csp = null`, so the webview ran without any Content-Security-Policy header. **Issue:** any compromise of the bundled JS, a leaked third-party dependency, or an injected iframe could exfiltrate to arbitrary origins; OS-level keychains and the `opener` plugin would happily forward whatever the page asked them to. **Why it mattered:** Pulse is a desktop/mobile shell that holds an OSN access token in memory, an HttpOnly session cookie at the API origin, and (in M2) E2E messaging keys; widening the loader's reach beyond the hosts the app actually contacts is the cheapest XSS-amplifier available. **Solution:** strict CSP object with explicit allowlists per directive — `connect-src` covers `'self'` + Tauri IPC (`ipc:`, `http://ipc.localhost`) + `https://photon.komoot.io` (geocoding) + `http://localhost:{3001,4000}` (dev API origins) + `https:` (production API origins, see Rationale below); `img-src` permits `'self'`, `data:` (Leaflet marker defaults), and `https://*.tile.openstreetmap.org` (map tiles); `style-src` includes `'unsafe-inline'` because Leaflet ships inline styles; `script-src` is `'self'` only; `object-src`, `frame-src`, `frame-ancestors`, `worker-src`, and `form-action` are `'none'` (defence-in-depth — Pulse uses no Workers, iframes, or native form actions; `<form>` submissions in Pulse are JS-handled with `preventDefault`). **Rationale:** the original S-L3 wording listed `maps.google.com` but those URLs are handed to `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener` (OS-level external open), not loaded inside the webview, so adding them would cargo-cult the allowlist wider for no defence benefit — they are intentionally omitted. The `https:` entry in `connect-src` is a transitional widening because production API origins aren't pinned in-repo; tracked as a follow-up to swap for the deployed `@osn/api` + `@pulse/api` hosts once they land in env. The `ipc:` + `http://ipc.localhost` entries are mandatory for Tauri v2 IPC — omitting them silently breaks `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener` and any future `invoke` calls.

## Pulse ARC registration retry (2026-04-24)

- **S-L1 (arc-retry)** — `isNetworkError` initially classified any `Error` with a string `code` property as a network-level fetch failure, which widened the "silent retry in local dev" surface beyond genuine connection errors (a parse error or AbortError with a `code` field would have been silently retried). The retry path is gated by `isLocalEnv()` + operator-controlled `OSN_ENV`, so the production blast radius was nil, but the JSDoc claim ("Bun populates `code` on network-level failures") over-sold the heuristic. Fixed: explicit allowlist of Bun/Node network codes (`ConnectionRefused`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `ECONNRESET`, `ENOTFOUND`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `EAI_AGAIN`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ENETUNREACH`, `UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, `UND_ERR_SOCKET`); any other shape surfaces as a throw. Covered by a local-dev test that asserts `ERR_INVALID_JSON` does not trigger the retry loop — see [[arc-tokens]].

## Auth Phase 5b — PKCE cleanup (2026-04-22)

- **S-H1 (auth 5b)** — Magic-link email URL previously pointed at `${issuerUrl}/login/magic/verify?token=...` (API origin). Clicking the link rendered a raw JSON response with `access_token` visible in the browser window, set the session cookie on the API domain (wrong origin, user not signed in to the app), and was vulnerable to email-client pre-fetchers (Defender SafeLinks, Outlook Protected View) burning the token or capturing it from URL access logs. Fixed: added `AuthConfig.magicLinkBaseUrl` (defaults to `config.origin`); email URL now points at the **frontend origin** with `?token=…`, and `/login/magic/verify` is now POST-only with the token in the body (consumed client-side by `MagicLinkHandler`). Restores the security posture of the removed authorization-code redirect without reintroducing PKCE.
- **S-M1 (auth 5b)** — `POST /token` accepted `refresh_token` in the request body as a cookieless fallback, while `toTokenResponseCookieOnly` intentionally omitted the rotated refresh token from the response — leaving body-fallback callers in a silent "works once, breaks on next rotation" trap and adding a log-leak surface. Fixed: body fallback removed entirely; `/token` reads the session token **only** from the HttpOnly cookie. The `osn.auth.session.cookie_fallback` counter + `metricSessionCookieFallback` helper were deleted.
- **S-L11 / S-L12 / S-L13 / S-L23 / S-M1 (auth) / S-M2 (auth) / S-L1 (pkce)** — Obsoleted by the PKCE flow removal: `pkceStore` (unbounded in-memory Map with no sweep, no size bound) deleted; `/authorize` route (unrate-limited) deleted; `REDIRECT_URI` client-side constant deleted; orphan PKCE verifier in localStorage deleted; PKCE `state` nonce validation moot. The `authorization_code` grant on `/token` is gone; the redirect-URI allowlist (`AuthConfig.allowedRedirectUris`, `validateRedirectUri`) is gone.

## Auth Phase 5b — Session reuse detection

- **S-H1 (session)** — The C2 reuse-detection map (`rotatedSessions`) was a single-process in-memory `Map`; in a multi-pod deployment a rotation recorded on pod A was invisible to pod B, so a replayed rotated-out token hitting B passed without triggering family revocation. Fixed: extracted `RotatedSessionStore` interface (`osn/api/src/lib/rotated-session-store.ts`) with in-memory + Redis-backed impls, wired from `osn/api/src/index.ts`. Fail-open on Redis error — an outage must not manufacture false-positive family revocations that log legitimate users out — with structured warning logs and a `{backend, action, result}` counter so ops dashboards surface degradation. — see [[sessions]]
- **S-M1 (session)** — The `onError` hook in `osn/api/src/index.ts` annotated logs with `error: String(cause)`, which would leak a credentialed `redis://user:pass@…` URL if ioredis ever embedded one in a connection-level error string. Fixed: route the cause through `sanitizeCause()` from `@shared/redis` before annotation, matching the convention already used by every other Redis error sink in the repo.
- **S-L1 (session)** — The prior design held a JSON-array family-set in Redis (`{ns}:fam:{familyId}`) to drive proactive `revokeFamily` cleanup. `track` was a three-round-trip read-modify-write with no cross-command atomicity, creating a theoretical race under concurrent rotations of the same family. Fixed: dropped the family set entirely. `track` is now a single `SET hashKey = familyId PX ttl`; the DB-level `DELETE FROM sessions WHERE family_id = ?` in `detectReuse` remains the authoritative family revocation. Stale `hash:*` keys expire under their own TTL.
- **S-L2 (session)** — `JSON.parse(existing) as string[]` on the family-set payload was a cast rather than a runtime guard — a malformed value written by a different process (migration, manual intervention) would have propagated a thrown error. Removed by the same family-set drop in S-L1.
- **S-L3 (session)** — `revokeFamily` spread every tracked hash into a single unbounded `DEL` command. Under adversarial `/token` flooding (within the existing rate-limit ceiling) the argument list could have grown large enough to press Redis protocol limits. Removed by the same family-set drop in S-L1.

## Auth Phase 5a (2026-04-19)

- **S-H1** — Step-up jti replay guard was single-process in-memory; a captured token could replay once per pod. Fixed: extracted `StepUpJtiStore` interface; Redis-backed implementation in `osn/api/src/lib/step-up-jti-store.ts` wired from startup, fail-closed on Redis errors. — see [[step-up]]
- **S-H2** — `beginEmailChange` leaked user existence via a distinct "Email already in use" error. Fixed: silently returns `{ sent: true }` on collision (matches `beginRegistration`'s anti-enumeration posture); the UNIQUE(email) constraint at `complete` remains the real defence.
- **S-H3** — `/account/email/begin` was an authenticated email-spam amplifier (per-IP only, bypassable via IP rotation). Fixed: per-account cap of 3 begins per 24h on top of the existing per-IP limit.
- **S-M1** — No per-account session cap; `revokeAccountSession` was O(N) scan. Fixed: `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_ACCOUNT = 50` with LRU-evict in `issueTokens`; revoke uses `LIKE 'handle%'` on the indexed PK.
- **S-M2** — `sessionIpPepper` silently disabled when unset in production. Fixed: fails loudly at startup when `OSN_SESSION_IP_PEPPER` is missing/short in non-local env. — see [[sessions]]
- **S-M4** — Session revoke returned distinct "Session not found" — handle-existence oracle. Fixed: idempotent `revokedSelf: false` on miss (matches `/logout` posture).
- **S-L1** — Step-up and email-change OTPs were tagged `purpose: "login"` on `osn.auth.otp.sent`. Fixed: extended `OtpSentAttrs.purpose` union with `"step_up"` and `"email_change"`.
- **S-L4** — Origin guard warning-only when allowlist empty. Fixed: throws at startup in non-local envs.
- **S-L5** — Email-change OTP message was phishing-friendly at misdelivered inboxes. Fixed: reframed with explicit "someone requested this on your account" so a mistaken recipient reads it as junk.

## Critical

- **S-C1** — Unbounded HTTP route metric cardinality from raw URL paths. Fixed: default `state.route = "unmatched"`.
- **S-C2** — Untrusted ARC `iss` claim became metric label before verification. Fixed: `safeIssuer()` guard, unknown issuers collapse to `"unknown"`.
- **S-C3** — User-supplied `category` unbounded on `pulse.events.created` metric. Fixed: closed `AllowedCategory` union + `bucketCategory()` helper.

## High

- **S-H1** — Rate limited all auth endpoints via per-IP fixed-window limiter. 5 req/min send, 10 req/min verify/complete. Also covers S-H2.
- **S-H2** — `GET /handle/:handle` rate limited at 10 req/IP/min (part of S-H1).
- **S-H3** — Open redirect in `/magic/verify`. Fixed: `allowedRedirectUris` on `AuthConfig`, validated at `/authorize`, `/magic/verify`, `/token`.
- **S-H4** — PKCE now mandatory at `/token`. Also validates redirect_uri match (S-M9).
- **S-H5** — Legacy unauth'd passkey path removed. `resolvePasskeyEnrollPrincipal` returns 401 without auth header.
- **S-H6** — No auth middleware on API routes (OWASP A01). Fixed: POST/PATCH/DELETE require auth.
- **S-H7** — No ownership check on mutating event operations. Fixed: `createdByUserId` NOT NULL + 403.
- **S-H8** — Graph GET endpoints unguarded. Fixed: try/catch with generic error messages.
- **S-H9** — `/register/complete` exploited PKCE bypass. Fixed: issues tokens directly.
- **S-H10** — TOCTOU between OTP verify and user insert. Fixed: unique constraint is source of truth.
- **S-H11** — `email.toLowerCase()` inconsistency. Fixed: lowercased form canonical throughout.
- **S-H12** — `GET /events/:id` didn't gate by `visibility`. Fixed: shared `loadVisibleEvent` helper.
- **S-H13** — `GET /events/:id/ics` leaked private event metadata. Fixed via `loadVisibleEvent`.
- **S-H14** — `GET /events/:id/comms` leaked organiser blast bodies. Fixed via `loadVisibleEvent`.
- **S-H15** — `GET /events/:id/rsvps?status=invited` leaked invite list. Fixed: only event organiser sees invitees.
- **S-H16** — `GET /events/:id/rsvps/counts` leaked private event existence. Fixed via `loadVisibleEvent`.
- **S-H17** — `/ready` probe leaked internal error messages. Fixed: opaque `{ status: "not_ready" }` response.
- **S-H18** — Inbound `traceparent` honoured unconditionally. Fixed: only extracted when ARC header present.
- **S-H19** — `x-request-id` unsanitised (log injection). Fixed: regex validation `/^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,64}$/`.
- **S-H20** — `instrumentedFetch` set `url.full` including query string (leaked OAuth codes). Fixed: no query component in span.
- **S-H1 (multi)** — Client/server field mismatch on passkey enrollment. Fixed: route accepts `profileId`, resolves `accountId` internally.
- **S-H2 (multi)** — Profile ID stored in `passkeys.accountId` column. Fixed: now passes `accountId`.
- **S-H3 (multi)** — Non-atomic account + profile creation. Fixed: wrapped in `db.transaction()`.
- **S-H2 (zap)** — Missing membership check on `GET /chats/:id`. Fixed: `assertMember` gate.
- **S-H3 (zap)** — Missing membership check on `GET /chats/:id/members`. Fixed: `assertMember` gate.
- **S-H4 (zap)** — `PATCH /chats/:id` differentiated 403/404 for non-members. Fixed: 404 for non-members.
- **S-H2 (org)** — Handle enumeration via error message. Fixed: "Handle unavailable".

## Medium

- **S-M2** — In-memory rate limiter resets on restart. Fixed: Redis shared counter (Phase 3).
- **S-M7** — Login OTP attempt limit added: wipes after 5 wrong guesses.
- **S-M9** — `redirect_uri` at `/token` matched against stored value (RFC 6749 §4.1.3). Fixed as part of S-H4.
- **S-M10** — `/passkey/register/begin` arbitrary `userId`. Fixed: auth required (part of S-H5).
- **S-M12** — `limit` query param in `listEvents` uncapped. Fixed: clamped to 1–100.
- **S-M15** — `is-blocked` route leaked whether target had blocked caller. Fixed: one-directional check.
- **S-M16** — No rate limiting on graph write endpoints. Fixed: 60/user/min.
- **S-M17** — Raw DB/Effect errors surfaced in graph responses. Fixed: `safeError()` helper.
- **S-M18** — No input validation on `:handle` route param. Fixed: TypeBox `HandleParam`.
- **S-M22** — `console.log` of OTP in dev fallback. Fixed: gated on `NODE_ENV !== "production"`.
- **S-M23** — `pendingRegistrations` Map unbounded. Fixed: 10k cap + sweep.
- **S-M24** — Biased modulo OTP generation. Fixed: rejection sampling in `genOtpCode()`.
- **S-M25** — Non-constant-time OTP comparison. Fixed: `timingSafeEqualString()`.
- **S-M26** — Differential error responses on `/register/begin`. Fixed: always returns `{ sent: true }`.
- **S-M27** — `close_friends` per-row visibility filter inverted directionality. Fixed: removed bucket; attendance visibility is `connections | no_one`.
- **S-M28** — `getConnectionIds`/`getCloseFriendIds` silently capped at 100. Fixed: raised to `MAX_EVENT_GUESTS` (1000).
- **S-M29** — No `maxLength` on event text fields. Fixed: title 200, description 5000, location/venue 500, category 100.
- **S-M30** — `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` parser tolerated malformed input (header smuggling). Fixed: strict regex validation.
- **S-M31** — Redaction deny-list missing `displayName`. Fixed: added alongside email/handle.
- **S-M32** — `span.recordException(error)` wrote properties outside redactor's reach. Fixed: scrubs via `redact()`.
- **S-M33** — `enrollmentToken` missing from redaction deny-list. Fixed: added both spellings.
- **S-M36** — Async `RateLimiterBackend.check()` rejection was fail-open. Fixed: fail-closed posture.
- **S-M37** — `AuthRateLimiters` type was mutable. Fixed: `Readonly<{...}>`.
- **S-M38** — `RedisLive` logs raw connection error (credential leak). Fixed: `sanitizeCause()`.
- **S-M39** — Redis rate limiter key built from unsanitised input. Fixed: namespace validated, key length bounded.
- **S-M40** — `RedisLive` does not enforce TLS. Fixed: logs warning without `rediss://` in production.
- **S-M41** — `createClientFromUrl()` bypassed TLS warning. Fixed: `initRedisClient()` checks and warns.
- **S-M42** — `initRedisClient()` logged raw `cause.message` (credential leak). Fixed: `sanitizeCause()`.
- **S-M44** — `verifyRefreshToken` didn't check `scope: "account"`. Fixed: guard requires scope.
- **S-M45** — `GET /profiles` sent refresh token in header. Fixed: changed to `POST /profiles/list` with body.
- **S-M46** — `POST /profiles/switch` lacked per-account rate limiting. Fixed: 20 switches/hr.
- **S-M1 (multi)** — Missing email index after UNIQUE removal. Fixed: re-added `users_email_idx`.
- **S-M2 (multi)** — `accountId` exposed in org `listMembers`. Fixed: stripped from projection.
- **S-M2 (org)** — No `org:write` scope constant. Fixed: `_SCOPE_ORG_WRITE` added.
- **Copenhagen Book M2** — Recovery codes: 10 × 64-bit single-use codes, SHA-256 hashed, tight rate limits (3/hr generate, 5/hr login), revoke-all-sessions on consume. See [[recovery-codes]].
- **Access-token TTL reduction** (S-M20 mitigation + S-L1 (social)) — default cut from 3600s → 300s. Client `authFetch` silent-refreshes on 401 via the HttpOnly session cookie so UX is unchanged. XSS blast radius on the localStorage access token drops from ~1h to ≤5min. See [[identity-model]].

## Low

- **S-L5** — `getSession()` returned expired tokens. Fixed.
- **S-L6** — OTP used `Math.random()`. Fixed: `crypto.getRandomValues`.
- **S-L8** — `getCloseFriendsOfBatch` accepted unbounded `userIds` array. Fixed: clamped to 1000.
- **S-L9** — Verbose DB internals in Effect error logs. Fixed: `safeErrorSummary()`.
- **S-L16** — `EventList` `console.error` logs raw server errors. Fixed: gated with `import.meta.env.DEV`.
- **S-L17** — `displayName` returned as `undefined` in graph responses. Fixed: `profileProjection()` normalises to `null`.
- **S-L18** — Graph rate-limit store never evicted expired windows. Fixed: shared `createRateLimiter` with sweep.
- **S-L20** — `sendBlast` logged blast body to stdout. Fixed: log removed.
- **S-L20** (observability) — `loadConfig` silently classified production as `dev`. Fixed: throws on mismatch.
- **S-L21** — `serializeRsvp` returned `invitedByUserId` to all viewers. Fixed: `isOrganiser` flag.
- **S-L25** — `createRateLimiter` exported from barrel (arbitrary config injection). Fixed: removed from barrel.
- **S-L26** — No runtime validation on injected `RateLimiterBackend` shape. Fixed: validated at boot.
- **S-L27** — `no-console` lint rule disabled. Fixed: enabled as `"warn"`.
- **S-L27** (redis) — `initRedisClient()` fail-open startup fallback. Fixed: `REDIS_REQUIRED=true` env var.
- **S-L28** — `createClientFromUrl()` eager ioredis connection. Fixed: `lazyConnect: true`.
- **S-L31** — No input format validation on `profile_id` in `/profiles/switch`. Fixed: TypeBox pattern.
- **S-L32** — `findDefaultProfile` ORDER BY relied on SQLite boolean-as-integer semantics. Fixed: explicit ordering.
- **S-L4 (org)** — No `maxLength` on internal route query params. Fixed: added 50 char limit.
