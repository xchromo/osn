# Cire development guide

What is true of cire and not of the rest of the monorepo. Everything else — branch
strategy, changesets, commit signing, hooks, the issue workflow, the wiki rules —
comes from the root `CLAUDE.md` and the platform pages, which are authoritative.

> **This page is the per-product pattern.** A product with enough of its own build
> conventions to be worth writing down gets `wiki/apps/<product>-development.md`,
> and its overview page links to it. Cire is the only one so far; pulse, zap and
> social still fit inside the platform pages. Put a fact here only when it is
> genuinely cire-only — if it applies to any other Solid or Workers package, it
> belongs in [[frontend-patterns]], [[backend-patterns]] or [[testing-patterns]]
> instead, where the person who needs it will actually find it.

Start at [[cire]] for what cire *is*, and [[cire-auth]] for the two-system auth
contract every route sits behind.

## Backend — Elysia on Workers, Effect in the service layer

The platform shape is in [[backend-patterns]]. Cire's departures:

- **`createApp` uses `aot: false`.** Elysia's ahead-of-time compilation builds
  handlers with `new Function`, which Cloudflare Workers forbids. This is not a
  tuning knob — the Worker fails to boot without it.
- **POST routes pass a sentinel `parse` hook** (`{ parse: () => ({}) }`) and read
  `request.json()` by hand, so malformed JSON degrades to the schema's own 400
  rather than a framework parse error.
- **Routes live in `cire/api/src/routes/`**, one route factory per domain (claim,
  rsvp, organiser, import), composed by `createApp` in `src/app.ts`. Handlers
  delegate to `cire/api/src/services/` and hold no logic.
- **Services return `Effect.Effect<A, E>`**; route handlers unwrap with
  `runCire` / `runCireSync`, never bare `Effect.runPromise` — the wrappers install
  the redacting logger ([[cire-workerd]]).
- **Errors are tagged classes** extending `Data.TaggedError`. Nothing in the
  service layer throws.
- **D1 access is Drizzle only** — no raw SQL string construction.
- **The Drizzle handle is built over the session-routing shim**, never over
  `env.DB` directly, and each Worker invocation opens exactly one D1 session at
  the entry point — see [[d1-read-replication]].
- **Effect is backend and DB only.** Never import it in `cire/invites`,
  `cire/host` or `cire/vendor`.
- **Cloudflare bindings are typed from `wrangler types`** output
  (`worker-configuration.d.ts`); regenerate after any schema or binding change.

### Middleware

Elysia plugins in `cire/api/src/middleware/`, all scoped `derive` + `onBeforeHandle`:

| File | Gate |
|---|---|
| `auth.ts` | `sessionAuth` — the guest claim-code cookie |
| `osn-auth.ts` | `osnAuth` — organiser JWT, via the shared Elysia adapter |
| `wedding-owner.ts` | owner only — codes, settings, removing/demoting a co-host, delete |
| `wedding-editor.ts` | owner or `editor` — module writes, the RSVP-by date, adding a co-host |
| `wedding-member.ts` | any role including `viewer` — reads + invite preview |
| `rate-limit.ts`, `turnstile.ts` | abuse gates |

Pick the gate from the roles matrix in [[cire-auth]], not by guessing from the
route name. (An `ownedWedding` "single owned wedding" middleware existed before
multi-wedding; it went when organisers could own several.)

## Tests

Platform conventions are in [[testing-patterns]]; the real-Chromium tier is in
[[browser-tests]]. Cire specifics:

- Test files sit beside their source as `*.test.ts`.
- **Integration tests run against a local D1 via `wrangler dev` — do not mock the
  database.**
- **`*.browser.test.tsx` runs in real Chromium**, not jsdom, for anything needing
  computed CSS, layout, paint or stacking order, sticky behaviour, or media
  emulation. Opt-in, with its own CI step. `@cire/host` has a browser tier too
  (added 2026-08-06): its ink tokens are translucent and it ships two ramps, so
  what a token measures as authored and what it measures as painted are different
  numbers. jsdom parses no stylesheet and reports zeroed rects — a class-contract
  assertion in the fast tier and a measurement in the browser tier are
  complements, not duplicates.
- The animation and layout bug classes that make the browser tier necessary are
  written up in [[frontend-patterns]] § Rendering and animation gotchas.
- **Cire does not yet use the platform `it.effect` + `createTestLayer()` idiom.**
  Aligning it is an open issue in `xchromo/osn`.

## Commands

Run from the OSN repo root. General commands are in [[commands]]; dev servers
answer on portless hostnames rather than ports ([[devloop-urls]]).

```bash
# Dev — cire API + guest + organiser, plus @osn/api (organiser sign-in needs the issuer)
bun run dev:cire
bun run --cwd cire/invites dev       # guest site only    → https://invite.cire.localhost
bun run --cwd cire/host dev          # organiser portal   → https://host.cire.localhost
bun run --cwd cire/api dev           # API only (Bun.serve entry; wrangler via dev:wrangler)

# Test
bun run --cwd cire/api test
bun run --cwd cire/invites test:browser   # real-Chromium tier
bun run --cwd cire/host test:browser
bun run test:browser                      # every package with a browser tier (turbo)

# Database — wrangler.toml lives in cire/api
cd cire/api && bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply cire-db --local
cd cire/api && bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply cire-db
cd cire/api && bunx wrangler types
```

Local sign-in also needs an `oauth_clients` row in the local OSN D1 and
`CIRE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` in `cire/api/.dev.vars`. Without them `/api/auth/oidc/*`
answers 503 and the rest of cire works as normal.

### Deploying by hand

CI does this on merge ([[production-deploy]]). By hand:

```bash
cd cire/api && bunx wrangler deploy --env production
```

**Never a bare `wrangler deploy`** — the config blocks it, deliberately.

The **guest site is a Worker, not Pages.** The adapter emits `dist/server` +
`dist/client` and a generated `dist/server/wrangler.json` extending
`cire/invites/wrangler.jsonc`; CI strips the unsupported `legacy_env` field first
(see `deploy.yml`).

```bash
bun run --cwd cire/invites build
cd cire/invites && bunx wrangler deploy --config dist/server/wrangler.json
```

## Guest-site SSR bundle size

Tracker #619 generalised this guard out of cire/invites: it is now
`scripts/guard-bundle-size.sh` (repo root, `worker` mode for this app), shared
with a `static`-mode measurement for the five non-SSR Astro apps. The
cross-app mechanism — where it runs, why it runs twice, every app's current
threshold — lives in [[bundle-size-guards]]. What stays here is what is
genuinely cire/invites-only: WHY its bundle is shaped the way it is.

In `worker` mode the script measures the gzip size of every deployable file
under `cire/invites/dist/server` (excluding the adapter's generated
`wrangler.json` and, since tracker #616's source-map follow-up, `.map` files —
`no_bundle: true` ships each chunk as its own module, so the sum of each
file's own gzip size is what actually crosses the wire). It also fails if any
`.map` file turns up under `dist/client`, which is served publicly as Static
Assets — see the source-map warning below.

`cire/invites/package.json`'s `build` script chains it on
(`… && ../../scripts/guard-bundle-size.sh . worker 175000`), so it fires
wherever the build actually executes: the by-hand deploy above, and any local
build. `ci.yml` and both `deploy.yml` jobs also invoke it as their own step
([[bundle-size-guards]] has the reason — a Turborepo cache replay of `build`
never runs the chained script). To re-baseline after an intentional bundle
change, build, read the printed total, and set the threshold — in all three
places — to that total plus **about 11.7 KB** of ordinary-growth headroom.

The headroom is deliberately smaller than the mistake the guard exists to
catch, and that is the part worth getting right. `motion` costs **21261 bytes
gzip in the minified build** — the size of its own already-minified client
vendor chunk, `dist/client/_astro/animate.*.js`, and the same figure you get by
rebuilding with `stubMotionForSsr()` removed. A threshold set to "measured plus
one motion" would put a fresh library of exactly that class *under* the line,
which is how the first version of this number went wrong: it carried 47657
bytes, motion's cost back when the build was unminified. The arithmetic is
spelled out in the comment above `threshold=` so the next reader can check it
without rebuilding.

Three tracker follow-ups (#618, #616, #617) to the original size audit
(#287) cut the bundle from 285 KB to 163 KB gzip:

- **Sessions off (#618).** Astro's session config accepts `session: false`
  (`astro/dist/core/session/config.js`), and `@astrojs/cloudflare`'s
  KV-binding auto-provisioning is gated on that same literal
  (`@astrojs/cloudflare/dist/index.js`, `if (session !== false && ...)`), so
  turning sessions off entirely — rather than pinning the in-memory driver —
  drops the session runtime and `unstorage` from `dist/server` with no KV
  binding required. Safe here because the guest site never reads or writes
  `Astro.session`.
- **SSR minification (#616).** `vite: { build: { minify: true } }` in
  `astro.config.mjs` does nothing for the server build: Astro's
  `createViteBuildConfig` (`astro/dist/core/build/vite-build-config.js`)
  spreads the user's `vite.build` and then hard-sets `minify: false`
  afterward for build-performance reasons, and separately replaces the `ssr`
  environment's whole `build` key, dropping any environment-scoped
  `minify` too. The fix is a small inline Astro integration hooking
  `astro:build:setup`, which Astro runs once (`target: "server"`) after that
  config exists, and whose `updateConfig` merges on top of it — the `prerender`
  and `ssr` environments inherit the resulting top-level `minify: true`; the
  `client` environment doesn't, because its own `minify` is set independently,
  so the client bundle is unaffected. The minifier under this Astro (Vite 8 /
  rolldown-vite) is OXC — pass `minify: true`, not `"esbuild"`.
- **Source maps, server-side only.** Minifying the server build means a
  production Worker exception no longer names a real source line, so this ships
  with `sourcemap: true` set **through the same `astro:build:setup` hook** as
  `minify`, plus `upload_source_maps: true` in `cire/invites/wrangler.jsonc` —
  the adapter never sets that key itself, so it has to come from the checked-in
  config the generated `dist/server/wrangler.json` extends. Both CI rewrite
  steps that touch that generated file (`deploy.yml`, dev and prod) only delete
  `legacy_env` and set `name`/`routes`, so the key survives into the deployed
  config untouched.

  > [!warning] Never set `sourcemap` as a plain `vite.build` value here.
  > Unlike `minify`, it is not overridden — it reaches the top level *and* the
  > client environment reads it
  > (`astro/dist/core/build/vite-build-config.js:135`), so the client build
  > emits `dist/client/_astro/*.js.map` too. `dist/client` is this Worker's
  > Static Assets directory (the adapter writes
  > `"assets": { "directory": "../client" }` into the generated wrangler
  > config) and Cloudflare serves everything in it verbatim, so those maps
  > publish the guest site's unminified source at `/_astro/<chunk>.js.map` to
  > anyone who asks. The plain form was written that way first and caught in
  > review; `guard-bundle-size.sh` now fails the build if any `.map` file appears
  > under `dist/client`.
- **`zod` stays (#617).** Traced to Astro's own actions request handler
  (`actions/handler.js` → `actions/runtime/server.js`, top-level
  `import * as z from "zod/v4/core"`), which `core/routing/handler.js` calls
  on every non-prerendered request whether or not the app defines any
  actions (`src/actions` doesn't exist here). There's no app-level config to
  skip that code path, so unlike `motion` (see the SSR-stub comment in
  `astro.config.mjs`) this is not stubbed — it's a real, reachable Astro core
  dependency, not dead weight from an unreachable path.
