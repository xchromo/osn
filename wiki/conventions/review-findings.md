# Review Finding IDs

All review skills (`/review-security`, `/review-performance`, `/review-tests`) tag findings with short IDs, so you can refer to them precisely in discussions, PR comments, and issue titles.

## Prefix Table

| Prefix | Skill | Tier |
|--------|-------|------|
| `S-C` | review-security | Critical |
| `S-H` | review-security | High |
| `S-M` | review-security | Medium |
| `S-L` | review-security | Low |
| `P-C` | review-performance | Critical |
| `P-W` | review-performance | Warning |
| `P-I` | review-performance | Info |
| `T-M` | review-tests | Missing file |
| `T-U` | review-tests | Untested export |
| `T-E` | review-tests | Error path |
| `T-R` | review-tests | Route test |
| `T-S` | review-tests | Suggestion |
| `C-C` | review-security (compliance section) | Critical compliance — blocks deploy / triggers regulatory exposure |
| `C-H` | review-security (compliance section) | High compliance — fix before next release |
| `C-M` | review-security (compliance section) | Medium compliance — schedule into next sprint |
| `C-L` | review-security (compliance section) | Low compliance — opportunistic fix or hardening |

## Numbering

Counters increment within each tier across the full report. For example, a security review might produce:

- `S-H1` -- first high-severity finding
- `S-H2` -- second high-severity finding
- `S-M1` -- first medium-severity finding
- `S-M2` -- second medium-severity finding
- `S-L1` -- first low-severity finding

## Finding Format

Each finding uses a four-field format:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Issue** | What is wrong or missing |
| **Why** | Why this matters (risk, impact) |
| **Solution** | Concrete fix or mitigation |
| **Rationale** | Why this solution is the right approach |

## Filing a finding

Findings live in **`xchromo/osn-tracker`**, a private repo. `xchromo/osn` is public, and a finding names an unpatched route -- filing one there publishes an attack map. Route by *kind*, never by severity: an `S-`, `P-`, or `C-` ID goes to the tracker however minor it looks.

One issue per finding, with the ID leading the title and the four fields as the body:

```bash
gh issue create --repo xchromo/osn-tracker \
  --title "S-M3 -- No rate limit on /foo endpoint" \
  --label "area:security" --label "severity:medium" --label "product:cire"
```

Labels, exactly one of each:

| Label | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `area:` | `security` for `S-*`, `performance` for `P-*`, `compliance` for `C-*` |
| `severity:` | from the tier letter -- `C` -> `critical`, `H`/`W` -> `high`, `M` -> `medium`, `L` -> `low`, `I` -> `info` |
| `product:` | `osn-core`, `pulse`, `cire`, `zap`, `shared`, `landing` |

Rules:

- **Close a finding, never delete it** -- the history matters, and a closed issue keeps the body, the fix commit, and the discussion. Deleting an issue is out of bounds for every script and command in this repo.
- A finding fixed on the branch that found it gets no issue of its own: put `Closes xchromo/osn-tracker#<n>` in the PR body, or if no issue existed, open one and close it with a comment naming the PR.
- Reference tracker issues from a public PR by number and finding ID only -- never the title, the file:line, or the body.
- Sorting is a filter now, not a file convention: `gh issue list --repo xchromo/osn-tracker --label severity:high --state open`.
- File new findings from PR reviews immediately, in `/prep-pr` Step 7.

`T-*` test findings are not filed. They are coverage gaps, not defects -- `/prep-pr` Step 4 raises them and they get closed in the branch or waved through.

## Usage in PR Comments

Finding IDs make PR discussions precise:

- "Fix S-H1 before merging"
- "P-C2 still open -- needs the batch query"
- "S-M34 is a known limitation, tracked in osn-tracker#412"
- "T-U3 -- this export has no test coverage"

Because the ID leads the title, the ID is also how you find the issue again:

```bash
gh issue list --repo xchromo/osn-tracker --search "S-M34 in:title" --state all
```
