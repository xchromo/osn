# Site-wide consent framework

Where the guest site's cookie/third-party consent lives, what it governs, and
the rules for adding a vendor to it. Code: `cire/invites/src/lib/consent/` (logic)
and `cire/invites/src/components/consent/` (UI).

## Why it exists

Before this, consent was a property of one component. `PinterestBoard.tsx`
carried its own `cire:pinterest-consent` localStorage key, its own module-level
signal, its own prompt and its own copy — and it was the *only* gate on the
site. The Google Maps venue embed made an equivalent transfer (guest IP + UA) to
an equivalent US recipient with no gate at all, not because anyone had decided
that was acceptable but because nobody had written it one. Consent lived
wherever someone had remembered to put it, which meant a new embed shipped
un-gated by default.

The framework fixes the structural problem rather than the Pinterest-shaped
symptom: every third party is governed by one wrapper and declared in one
registry, so a new embed either goes through the gate or is a visible, deliberate
omission. Note this is about *control*, not about the answer — the defaults are
opt-out (below), so a wrapped embed does load for an undecided guest. What the
wrapper guarantees is that the guest can see it listed and switch it off, which
the old arrangement could not offer for anything but Pinterest.

## The model

**Categories are the unit of consent** — a guest allows "third-party content",
not "Pinterest" and "Google Maps" separately. Vendors declare which category
they belong to; the dialog toggles categories and lists the vendors under each.
Granting from a blocked embed's in-place button grants the whole category, and
the button says so, because a hidden per-vendor grant would not appear in the
preferences dialog and so could never be withdrawn.

| Category | Required? | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `necessary` | yes, locked | `cire_session` claim cookie, Turnstile, the consent record itself |
| `functional` | no | Remembered UI preferences |
| `embeds` | no | Pinterest moodboard, Google Maps venue embed, Google Fonts (see below) |
| `analytics` | no | Nothing today — the slot exists so adding analytics later is a config line, not a new framework |

There is deliberately **no `marketing` / `advertising` category**. We don't do
it, and an unused toggle is a claim we'd have to keep true.

## Defaults: opt-out, except analytics

| Category | Applies before a decision? |
|---|---|
| `necessary` | yes (locked) |
| `functional` | **yes** |
| `embeds` | **yes** |
| `analytics` | no |

`embeds` and `functional` are **opt-out**: they apply to a guest who hasn't
decided, and the banner's job is to say so and offer the off switch. That is a
product decision for a private wedding invite — the venue map and the moodboard
are content the couple put there for their guests — and it sits within the
Australian framing the privacy notice sets out. It is **not** the ePrivacy
posture for EU/UK visitors, who are entitled to prior consent. A known, accepted
trade, recorded here so nobody later mistakes it for an oversight. Reversing it
is one `defaultGranted` field in `categories.ts` plus two paragraphs of copy.

`analytics` stays opt-in regardless, and the asymmetry is the point: nothing
uses that category today, so a default couldn't be *informed* about anything. An
analytics tag added later must not inherit consent from guests who were never
told it existed.

### Three grant maps, and why they can't be collapsed

| Function | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `defaultGrants()` | **The floor.** Required only. What "Reject all" writes, AND what applies before the cookie has been read. |
| `preDecisionGrants()` | **Unasked.** The opt-out defaults above. |
| `allGrants()` | Everything. What "Accept all" writes. |

Two traps this separation exists to avoid:

1. **Refused ≠ unasked.** Under opt-in these were the same effective state, so
   one function served both. Under opt-out they differ in what they *allow*, so
   collapsing them would silently re-enable embeds for a guest who switched them
   off.
2. **Pre-hydration ≠ unasked.** `record() === null` means "we haven't looked
   yet" before hydration and "we looked, there's nothing" after. Only the second
   may resolve to the permissive defaults; the first must hold at the floor, or
   every page load would ignore a refusal for one tick. Enforced in
   `store.ts`'s `isCategoryGranted`.

## Files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `lib/consent/categories.ts` | The category enum + display metadata. `necessary` is the only required one. |
| `lib/consent/vendors.ts` | **The vendor registry** — one source of truth (see below). |
| `lib/consent/record.ts` | The persisted record: versions, grant normalisation, encode/decode. |
| `lib/consent/cookie.ts` | Cookie transport (`__Host-cire_consent` / `cire_consent`). |
| `lib/consent/store.ts` | Module-level Solid signals shared by every island. |
| `lib/consent/testing.ts` | `seedConsentForTest` / `resetConsentForTest`. |
| `components/consent/ConsentGate.tsx` | The wrapper + the default blocked-content placeholder. |
| `components/consent/ConsentBanner.tsx` | First-layer banner + the standing `ConsentPreferencesLink`. |
| `components/consent/ConsentPreferences.tsx` | The "Choose" dialog. |

## The vendor registry is the source of truth

`vendors.ts` drives the preferences dialog, the `/privacy` page's third-party
list, and (by test assertion) the CSP origin allowlist in
`lib/security-headers.ts`. The same facts used to be maintained in four places
that drifted independently — the consent copy inside the component, the privacy
prose, the CSP, and `wiki/compliance/subprocessors.md`. Adding a vendor meant
four edits, and forgetting one produced either a CSP block (loud) or an
undeclared transfer (silent, and the one that matters).

**To add a third party:**

1. Add a `ConsentVendor` entry to `CONSENT_VENDORS`.
2. Add its origins to `CSP_DIRECTIVES` in `lib/security-headers.ts` —
   `vendors.test.ts` fails until you do.
3. Wrap the component in `<ConsentGate category="…" vendor="…">`. If it lands in
   a category that is on by default, it starts loading for everyone — check that
   is what you want, and that the banner copy still names it.
4. Bump `CONSENT_POLICY_VERSION` in `record.ts` (this re-prompts everyone — see
   below).
5. Add a row to the root `[[compliance/subprocessors]]` register.

### `enforcement: "gated" | "always"`

Each vendor states plainly whether the gate actually blocks it. A registry that
listed a vendor the gate didn't block would be a lie told in a compliance-shaped
voice.

- `"gated"` — the guest's choice genuinely controls it: no request is made while
  the category is switched off. Pinterest and Google Maps both mount inside the
  click-opened details sheet, so they never appear in server-rendered HTML and a
  client-side gate is sufficient. (With `embeds` on by default, "gated" means
  *switchable*, not *withheld by default*.)
- `"always"` — loads regardless. **Google Fonts only**, because the font
  `<link>` sits in the `<head>` of the server-rendered document. The right fix
  is to delete the vendor (self-host the two woff2 families), not to put the
  site's typography behind a switch and swap the typeface mid-visit. Tracked as
  an issue under `label:product:cire`. Until then the dialog and `/privacy` both say "loads on every
  visit" rather than implying the toggle covers it.

## Storage

A cookie, `Path=/`, `Max-Age` 182 days, `SameSite=Lax`. Not `HttpOnly` — client
code rewrites it.

**Two names, chosen by `secure`.** On https the cookie is written as
`__Host-cire_consent`; on http (local dev) it falls back to the bare
`cire_consent`, because `__Host-` cookies are rejected outright without
`Secure`, which http can never set. A read accepts BOTH names and prefers the
prefixed one when both are present. This is osn-tracker#163 (S-L1): without the
prefix, a script on a sibling `*.cireweddings.com` origin could set its own
`Domain=.cireweddings.com` cookie of the same bare name, and which of the two
same-named cookies a browser returns first is unspecified — so a guest's
stored REFUSAL could be silently overridden back to "allowed". `__Host-` is a
browser-enforced promise (rejected without `Secure`, `Path=/`, and no
`Domain`), which the cookie's existing attributes already satisfy.

**The bare name is removed, not merely out-ranked.** Preferring the prefixed
name on read only defends this origin, and only once the prefixed cookie
actually exists — so two writes end the ambiguity rather than out-running it:

- a secure write also expires the bare name, so saving clears the old cookie;
- `hydrateConsent` calls `migrateBareConsentCookie` on the way in, which on a
  secure origin moves a bare-name record onto the prefixed name and expires the
  bare one.

The second is the one that matters, and it is not belt-and-braces. `saveConsent`
runs only when a guest touches the consent UI, and a guest who has already
decided is exactly the one the banner never shows again — their stored choice
reads back fine through the bare-name fallback, so `needsConsentDecision()`
stays false and nothing would ever perform the secure write. Without a migration
on the READ path, their refusal would stay shadowable for the cookie's full 182
days. Migrating on read moves them silently on their next visit. On http dev
there is nothing to migrate: `__Host-` needs `Secure`, so the bare name is the
correct and only form there.

A page cannot delete a `Domain=.cireweddings.com` cookie another origin set, and
does not try — the read precedence is what defends against that one. The expiry
is host-only, `Path=/`, no `Domain`, so it clears our own old cookie and nothing
else.

**Why a cookie and not `localStorage`** (which the old Pinterest gate used): a
cookie is the only store the server can read. Both currently-gated embeds mount
client-side, so localStorage would technically do — but that is a property of
where those two components happen to live, not of the framework. The moment a
third party needs to load from the `<head>` or from SSR'd markup (an analytics
tag, a chat widget, the font `<link>`), a client-side store is structurally too
late: the request has gone before any script reads it.

`SameSite=Lax` not `Strict`, because a guest arriving from the couple's emailed
link is a cross-site top-level navigation and `Strict` would withhold the cookie
on exactly that first hop — re-prompting someone who already decided.

### Withdrawal tears down what already ran (osn-tracker#162 / CON-S-M1)

Switching a category off unmounts its gated embeds immediately — `ConsentGate`
doesn't render children, it disposes them, so no further request escapes. But a
vendor's script that already ran before the switch flipped has already set its
own globals, attached its own listeners and written its own storage, and none
of that unwinds just because the DOM node is gone. Under the opt-out defaults
this is the common case, not an edge one: the banner appears only after the
gated embeds have already loaded, so "Reject all" is nearly always clicked with
a third-party context already live.

`saveConsent` (`store.ts`) reloads the page — `location.reload()`, via an
injectable module-level `reloadPage` reference so tests can substitute a spy —
whenever a category holding at least one `enforcement: "gated"` vendor moves
from granted to revoked in that save. Two conditions gate it, both load-bearing:

1. **Granted → revoked only.** Not revoked → granted, not a no-op save, not a
   first-time grant — none of those leave anything to tear down.
2. **The cookie write must have actually succeeded**, checked with a read-back
   of `document.cookie` (`writeConsentToDocumentAndVerify` in `cookie.ts`)
   rather than trusting that the write call merely returned — it swallows
   failures by design (see "Storage" above). Reloading on an unpersisted
   refusal would discard the very refusal the reload exists to enforce: the
   guest would watch the page reload believing they'd just refused, and land
   back on the opt-out defaults with no record of having tried.

The preferences dialog states this plainly rather than leaving it implicit — a
silent reload the guest didn't expect is its own kind of surprising.

### Two versions, two jobs

- `CONSENT_RECORD_VERSION` — the storage shape. Bump when the record's structure
  changes incompatibly.
- `CONSENT_POLICY_VERSION` — the disclosure. **Bump whenever the vendor list or
  what a vendor does materially changes.** A guest who agreed to a Pinterest
  embed has not thereby agreed to whatever we add next month, so their stored
  consent was never *informed* about the newcomer and cannot be reused. A
  mismatch decodes to `null`, which re-prompts.

### `null` vs "refused everything"

The distinction the design turns on. `null` (no record) means **never asked** →
show the banner. A record with every optional grant `false` means **refused** →
never re-ask. A banner that reappeared after a refusal would be nagging the
guest towards consent.

## Hydration rule

`record()` starts `null` and is only populated in `hydrateConsent()`, which runs
from `onMount`. This keeps the server-rendered markup and the first client
render identical (both show the un-consented state), and nothing third-party can
load in the gap because gates deny until the same hydration completes. Every
gate calls `hydrateConsent` itself rather than depending on a banner having
mounted first.

## UI rules that are not negotiable

- **The banner states that things are already on.** It names Google and
  Pinterest and says the content is switched on with an offer to turn it off,
  rather than posing a question whose answer has been assumed. Asserted by test.
- **Reject is as easy as accept.** All three banner actions render through one
  `BannerButton` component, so they carry identical styling by construction —
  making accept "primary" would mean deliberately breaking them apart.
  `ConsentBanner.test.tsx` asserts the classNames match. This matters *more*
  under opt-out, not less: the off switch is the only thing a guest who
  disagrees with the default actually has.
- **Rendering never writes a record.** The defaults apply without fabricating a
  decision, so the banner keeps appearing until the guest genuinely makes one.
  An implied consent silently promoted to a stored, timestamped one would cost
  them the chance to refuse.
- **The dialog's toggles show what is actually loading** — ticked for `embeds`
  and `functional` on a first visit. A dialog showing `embeds` unticked while
  the map was on screen would describe a state the site is not in.
- **The dialog's toggles are a local draft** until Save. A guest who flicks a
  switch to see what it covers and then closes the dialog has granted nothing.
- **Withdrawal is permanent and findable** — `ConsentPreferencesLink` in
  `SiteFooter.astro` on every page, plus a copy on `/privacy`.
- **Consent layers sit above everything** (`Z_LAYER.CONSENT` = 200,
  `CONSENT_DIALOG` = 210). Blocked embeds live inside the details modal, so the
  dialog opened from one must not be buried behind it.

Only one mounted component renders the dialog at a time
(`claimConsentDialogHost`), or a page with both a banner and a footer link would
open two stacked copies with two independent drafts.

## Legacy migration

The old `cire:pinterest-consent` key is **deleted on hydration, not migrated**.
That click consented to Pinterest specifically; the `embeds` category now also
covers the Google Maps embed, so importing it would silently widen a narrow
consent into a broader one the guest was never shown. Those guests are asked
once more — the honest cost of consolidating the gates.

## Where it's mounted

`<ConsentBanner client:idle />` in all four document shells:
`designs/classic/Document.astro`, `designs/gala/Document.astro`,
`layouts/LegalLayout.astro`, `components/NotFoundDocument.astro`.

## Not covered

- **The organiser portal** (`cire/host`) has no consent surface. It loads
  no third-party embeds, and its users are authenticated hosts rather than
  guests. If it ever gains one, promote `lib/consent/` to a `@cire/consent`
  package rather than copying it.
- **Google Fonts** — see `enforcement: "always"` above.
