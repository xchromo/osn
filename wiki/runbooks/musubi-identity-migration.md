# Migrating OSN identity to musubi.dev

Moving osn-api from `id.cireweddings.com` to `id.musubi.dev`, with
`musubi.dev` becoming the full OSN identity home: issuer, sign-in UI, and
consent screen. This is the "dedicated OSN domain" that
`[[production-deploy]]` has carried as deferred since the first prod deploy.

**This is not a hostname swap.** Two hard dependencies must land before the
cutover, or cire loses sign-in entirely. Read the blockers first.

## Why it cannot be config-only

### Blocker 1 — the authorize UI ✅ cleared 2026-07-26

The consent screen is built and deployed: `/authorize` in `@osn/social`, see
`[[authorize-ui]]`. The paragraphs below stay because they explain why this
ordering is not optional.

This matters because of WebAuthn scoping. A passkey ceremony may only run on
an origin that is same-site with the RP ID. Once `OSN_RP_ID` becomes
`musubi.dev`, the cire origins (`host.`, `vendor.`, `invite.cireweddings.com`)
**can no longer run ceremonies at all** — they are a different registrable
domain. Their replacement is the OIDC redirect flow, which needs the very
page that does not exist.

Flip the RP ID before that page ships and cire has neither mechanism: direct
ceremonies are illegal, and the redirect flow dead-ends.

### Blocker 2 — `@osn/social` is not deployed ✅ cleared 2026-07-26

`deploy.yml` now carries a `deploy-osn-social` job: the `osn-social` Pages
project, served at `me.cireweddings.com`, with
`OSN_AUTHORIZE_UI_URL = https://me.cireweddings.com/authorize`. Feature-branch
previews were moved to a separate `osn-social-preview` project so a push to a
branch can no longer overwrite what a live hostname serves.

`[[authorize-ui]]` requires it be served under the **same registrable domain
as osn-api**, because the session cookie and the per-request OIDC binding
cookie are host-bound and only flow on same-site fetches with
`credentials: "include"`. `me.cireweddings.com` satisfies that today. After
the move it must live on `musubi.dev` instead — that hostname change is part
of PR D, not a separate blocker.

### Why partial moves do not help

Moving only the issuer hostname while keeping `OSN_RP_ID = cireweddings.com`
does not sidestep either blocker. It makes every cire→OSN call cross-site, so
the `SameSite=Lax` `__Host-osn_session` cookie stops being sent and silent
refresh dies at the first 401 (~5 minutes after sign-in). Relaxing to
`SameSite=None` turns it into a third-party cookie: blocked outright by
Safari's ITP, and on Chrome's deprecation path. There is no config-only
ordering that is safe.

## Credential bridge — do this first

Changing `OSN_RP_ID` invalidates **every existing passkey**. Sessions do not
bridge the move either: `__Host-` is exact-domain by prefix, so
`__Host-osn_session` set on `id.cireweddings.com` is not sent to
`id.musubi.dev`. An account whose only credential is a passkey, with no
recovery codes, is permanently locked out the moment the RP ID flips —
every step-up route requires an existing access token, and the only
unauthenticated door is `POST /login/recovery/complete`.

Recovery-code login is RP-ID-independent (identifier + code, no WebAuthn),
which is exactly why it survives the flip.

**A passkey cannot be migrated to a new RP ID.** The `passkeys` table holds
only the public half; the private key lives in the authenticator and is bound
to the RP ID at creation. Nothing written to D1 re-points an existing
credential — after the flip both rows are dead weight and both users enroll
fresh. Enrolment requires an authenticated session, hence the bridge.

Confirmed prod inventory (2026-07-25) — the whole blast radius is two
credentials on two accounts, and **neither account has any recovery codes**:

| Account | Passkey | Last used | Unused codes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chavaniket@duck.com` | `pk_f7cbfe55345a` | 2026-07-23 | 0 |
| `mdpasupati@gmail.com` | `pk_dd04a0f8beff` | 2026-07-19 | 0 |

Small enough that re-enrolment is a chore rather than a migration — but both
accounts still need a code set minted before the flip, or neither has a way
back in.

**Before touching the RP ID, for every account that must survive:**

1. Sign in on the current domain while passkeys still work.
2. `POST /recovery/generate` (step-up gated — see `[[recovery-codes]]`).
   Store the 10 codes offline.

**After cutover, to re-establish a credential:**

1. `POST /login/recovery/complete` — identifier + code. Returns a session.
2. `POST /step-up/otp/begin` → `/step-up/otp/complete` with purpose
   `passkey_register`. OTP is email-based, so it does not need a passkey.
3. Enroll a fresh passkey under the new RP ID.
4. `POST /recovery/generate` again — the consumed set is spent.

> `OSN_PAIRWISE_SALT` must be set on `osn-api-production` for **any** of this
> to work. The boot check is fail-closed, so without it every route 503s
> regardless of which domain it answers on. See `[[production-deploy]]`.

## Config inventory

Everything that names the issuer today. `staging` and `dev` keep their
current values unless the whole ladder moves.

| Where | Key | Now → after |
|---|---|---|
| `osn/api/wrangler.toml` `[env.production.vars]` | `OSN_RP_ID` | `cireweddings.com` → `musubi.dev` |
| ″ | `OSN_ISSUER_URL` | `https://id.cireweddings.com` → `https://id.musubi.dev` |
| ″ | `OSN_ORIGIN` | cire origins → musubi.dev ceremony origins |
| ″ | `OSN_CORS_ORIGIN` | cire origins → musubi.dev surfaces |
| ″ | `OSN_AUTHORIZE_UI_URL` | `https://me.cireweddings.com/authorize` → the musubi.dev host |
| ″ | `OSN_EMAIL_FROM` | `hello@cireweddings.com` → a verified musubi.dev sender |
| ″ `[[env.production.routes]]` | `pattern` | `id.cireweddings.com` → `id.musubi.dev` |
| `cire/api/wrangler.toml` | `OSN_JWKS_URL`, `OSN_ISSUER_URL` | both hosts (staging + production blocks) |
| `zap/api/wrangler.toml` | `OSN_JWKS_URL`, `OSN_API_URL` | both |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | `PUBLIC_OSN_ISSUER_URL` | three occurrences |
| `.github/workflows/deploy-cire-preview.yml` | `PUBLIC_OSN_ISSUER_URL` | two occurrences |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | `VITE_OSN_ISSUER_URL` (`deploy-osn-social`) | one occurrence |
| `.github/workflows/deploy-osn-social-preview.yml` | `VITE_OSN_ISSUER_URL` | one occurrence |
| `cire/web/src/lib/security-headers.ts` | `osnIssuer` + CSP `connect-src` | hardcoded — must track the issuer |

Out-of-band, not in the repo:

- **Zone.** `musubi.dev` must be in the same Cloudflare account for
  `custom_domain = true` to auto-provision DNS + edge cert. **Not confirmed
  yet** — check the account's zone list before planning the route flip.
- **Resend.** Verify `musubi.dev` as a sender domain before moving
  `OSN_EMAIL_FROM`, or OTP and security mail fail closed. **Confirmed
  outstanding (2026-07-26):** the Resend account has only `cireweddings.com`
  verified. Nothing can send from musubi.dev today.
- **Turnstile.** Add the musubi.dev hostnames to the widget's domain list —
  the verifier is fail-closed once a secret is set (`[[turnstile]]`).
- **Pages custom domain.** `me.cireweddings.com` must be attached to the
  `osn-social` Pages project in the dashboard (step 5), and re-pointed at the
  musubi.dev host in step 7. A Pages custom domain is a dashboard setting, not
  a wrangler route — the deploy job cannot create it.

## Cutover order

1. ✅ Set `OSN_PAIRWISE_SALT` on `osn-api-production`. Prerequisite for every
   later step; also ended the outage it was causing.
2. ✅ Mint recovery codes for every account that must survive (above).
3. Add `musubi.dev` to Cloudflare; verify the Resend sender domain.
4. ✅ Build the `/authorize` page in `@osn/social` per `[[authorize-ui]]`
   (2026-07-26).
5. ✅ Add an osn-social Pages job to `deploy.yml` (2026-07-26). It deploys to
   `me.cireweddings.com` first — the domain the cookies already work on — and
   moves to musubi.dev in step 7. **Dashboard step outstanding:** attach
   `me.cireweddings.com` to the `osn-social` Pages project, or the job
   publishes to `osn-social.pages.dev` and `OSN_AUTHORIZE_UI_URL` points at
   nothing.
6. Register cire as an OIDC client; convert organiser, vendor and web from
   direct `@osn/client` ceremonies to the redirect flow.
7. Flip the osn-api vars + route, and the osn-social Pages custom domain.
   Redeploy downstream verifiers so cire-api and zap-api pick up the new
   JWKS URL.
8. Re-enroll passkeys under the new RP ID; regenerate recovery codes.

Step 6 is the real work left. Steps 3 and 7–8 are mechanical.

### Do not ship steps 5–7 as one change

The move is safest split into four PRs, because it separates "does the OIDC
flow work at all" from "does it work on a new domain". Debugging both at once
is what turns a cutover into an outage.

- **A — the consent screen.** Done: `/authorize` in `@osn/social`.
- **B — deploy `@osn/social` where the cookies already work.** Done
  2026-07-26: the `deploy-osn-social` Pages job serves it from
  `me.cireweddings.com`, a host under the **current** registrable domain, and
  `OSN_AUTHORIZE_UI_URL` points at it. The binding and session cookies are
  host-bound to `id.cireweddings.com` and same-site with that host, so the
  whole authorize → consent → token round-trip is testable today, on the
  domain that already works.
- **C — convert cire to the redirect flow.** Register cire as an OIDC client
  and move organiser, vendor and web off direct `@osn/client` passkey
  ceremonies, still on cireweddings.com. This is the change that removes
  cire's dependence on the RP ID, and it can be proven before the RP ID moves.
- **D — the move itself.** Flip the vars, the route and the Pages hostname.
  With A–C landed, the only thing that breaks is the passkeys, and step 2's
  recovery codes are the bridge across that.

Ordering C before D is what makes D reversible: after C, cire never runs a
WebAuthn ceremony of its own, so changing the RP ID cannot take cire's
sign-in with it.

## Rollback

Before step 7, rollback is reverting a branch — nothing user-visible has
moved. After step 7 the exposure is the RP ID: reverting it restores the old
passkeys (credentials are not deleted server-side, only unusable under a
different RP ID), but any passkey enrolled under `musubi.dev` in the meantime
stops working. Keep the recovery-code sets from step 2 until re-enrolment is
confirmed on the new domain.

`OSN_PAIRWISE_SALT` is the one thing that must **never** be rotated in a
rollback — it is the HMAC key behind every pairwise `sub`. See
`[[oidc-provider]]`.
