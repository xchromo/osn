# Gift registry

Phase 4 module. The couple curate a gift list; guest **households** claim from it so nobody buys the same thing twice; the couple work from a gift log afterwards to write thank-yous. Card contributions ride Stripe Connect and land in a later PR — everything below is usable as an honour-system list with no Stripe account at all.

> **It is locked.** The `registry` entitlement is granted to no wedding, so every route in this page answers `402 payment_required` in production today. See [[cire-entitlements]] for the mechanism and the comp-grant CLI. Nothing here is reachable until someone grants it.

---

## Why the module looks like this

Three decisions shape everything else, and each was taken against a specific failure:

1. **Claim ≠ purchase.** A household reserving on the honour system and a household actually sending money are different facts. Collapsing them into one "taken" flag loses what the couple need to know when they sit down to write thank-yous, so claims and contributions are separate tables merged only at read time.
2. **Guests see counts, never names.** A guest sees "1 of 2 left". Who claimed, how much anyone gave, and any running total are couple-only. This is a privacy property, not a UI preference — the guest read path never selects a claimant identity.
3. **A released claim is a tombstone, not a delete.** A guest who changes their mind must be able to free the item. Making that a delete would let the (item, household) unique pair be re-created and re-created, and would lose the fact that they had once claimed it.

## Database schema (migration 0057)

### `registry_settings`

One row per wedding, keyed by `wedding_id` (PK + FK cascade). **An absent row reads exactly as `published = 0`**, so a wedding that never opened the registry and one that turned it off are the same state to every caller.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `published` | Guest visibility. The guest read requires this **and** the entitlement — two independent gates, so an entitlement lapsing can't silently republish a registry the couple turned off, and vice versa |
| `headline`, `message` | The couple's copy above the list ("no boxed gifts please"). NULL ⇒ nothing renders |
| `cash_gifts_enabled` | Off by default and independently of `published` |
| `shipping_address`, `shipping_visible_from` | Shown to claimed guests only; the date is the "don't ship until we're back" pattern |
| `stripe_account_id`, `stripe_charges_enabled`, `stripe_payouts_enabled`, `stripe_account_updated_at` | Connect state, cached from the `account.updated` webhook so the portal needs no live Stripe call per page load |

### `registry_items`

`id` (`reg_*`) · `wedding_id` · `kind` (`product` \| `cash_fund`) · `title` · `description` · `image_key` + `image_crop` · `external_url` · `price_minor` · `quantity_wanted` · `allow_partial` · `target_minor` · `category` · `sort_order` · timestamps. Indexed `(wedding_id, sort_order, id)` — every list read filters and orders on exactly that triple, and `id` is in the index because it is the tie-break for equal `sort_order` (without it the sort spills to a temp b-tree).

Two CHECK constraints: `quantity_wanted >= 1` and `kind in ('product','cash_fund')`. The service validates both first and returns a typed error; the constraints are there for the paths the service doesn't own — a fixture, a migration, a future import.

`kind = 'cash_fund'`, `allow_partial` and `target_minor` are declared but unused: they are the named-fund and group-gifting seams, so adding either is UI work rather than a migration.

**`price_minor` carries no currency code.** See [Money](#money) — that is deliberate, not an omission.

### `registry_claims`

`id` (`rcl_*`) · `wedding_id` · `item_id` · `family_id` · `quantity` · `status` (`reserved` \| `purchased` \| `released`) · `note` · `display_name` · `thanked_at` / `thanked_by` · timestamps.

`wedding_id` is denormalised from the item so the gift log filters without a join and a wedding delete cascades even once the item is gone. `display_name` covers "thank Auntie Ros", where the household name isn't who to write to.

**Unique `(item_id, family_id)`.** One row per household per item — re-claiming updates it rather than stacking rows, which is what makes the quantity arithmetic below tractable.

CHECK `quantity between 1 and 99` and `status in ('reserved','purchased','released')`. The 99 ceiling matches `MAX_CLAIM_QUANTITY` in the service: a claim is a household saying how many of a listed gift they will bring, so a four-digit quantity is a typo or an attack, never a fact.

Two covering indexes carry the hot reads. `(item_id, status, family_id, quantity)` serves the claim statement's `sum(quantity)` sub-select — every column it touches is in the index, so the guard never visits the table. `(wedding_id, item_id, status, quantity)` serves the list read's per-item claimed-count rollup for a whole wedding in one index scan.

### `registry_contributions`

One row per Stripe Checkout Session. `stripe_checkout_session_id` is **unique**, and that uniqueness is the webhook idempotency anchor — the same role `provider_ref` plays for entitlement grants. A replayed `checkout.session.completed` conflicts there instead of writing a second gift.

`item_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, not cascade: removing a listing must never erase the record of money someone actually sent.

### Invite copy

`wedding_invite_customisations` gains `registry_eyebrow`, `registry_heading`, `registry_body`, `registry_tone` — the same nullable-means-built-in-default contract as the story/details headers, so every pre-0057 invite renders unchanged.

---

## Money

**The wedding has one primary currency** — `weddings.currency`, already shared with [[cire-budget]]. The registry reuses it and introduces no second source of truth.

- **Everything the organiser authors is in the primary currency.** `registry_items.price_minor` has no currency column of its own. A gift list quoted in four currencies is unreadable, and a per-item currency is the change that makes it one.
- **Only received money can be foreign.** A contribution stores `amount_minor` + `currency` **as given**, plus `primary_amount_minor` + `primary_currency` + `fx_rate` + `fx_rate_at` — the primary-currency equivalent. All four are NULL when the gift arrived in the primary currency, which is the common case, and the UI then shows a single figure.
- **The host reads the as-given amount as the primary visual, with the primary-currency line underneath.** Never a silently converted single figure.
- **Rates are snapshotted per gift and never recomputed.** A gift log that re-values itself whenever rates move is not a record of anything.

The rate comes from **Stripe's balance transaction** (`exchange_rate`), not a third-party FX feed: it is authoritative, free, arrives with a webhook already being handled, and matches what actually reached the couple's bank. No new subprocessor and no scheduled rate fetch. When no balance transaction is available yet the FX columns stay NULL and the figure renders alone — the degraded state is the common state, which is the right way round.

**Totals** sum `primary_amount_minor` only (falling back to `amount_minor` where the currencies already match) and must be labelled approximate: each row was converted at its own snapshotted rate, so the sum is of historical conversions, not a live valuation.

Rendering goes through `formatMinorPair` in `cire/host/src/lib/money.ts`. That module also knows each currency's **real minor-unit exponent** — JPY has none (1000 minor units is ¥1000, not ¥10) and KWD/BHD/JOD use three. The old fixed `/ 100` was invisible while every wedding was in AUD and is wrong by 100× the moment a gift arrives in yen.

---

## Claim concurrency

Two guests clicking the last item at the same moment is the **ordinary case** for a registry, not an edge case, and SQLite has no row-level lock a read-then-write can rely on.

`registryService.claim` is therefore a single statement. The remaining-quantity check lives in the INSERT's `WHERE`, so it re-evaluates as part of the write:

```sql
INSERT INTO registry_claims (…)
SELECT …, ri.wedding_id, ri.id, …
FROM registry_items ri
WHERE ri.id = ? AND ri.wedding_id = ?
  AND ? + coalesce((
        SELECT sum(rc.quantity) FROM registry_claims rc
        WHERE rc.item_id = ri.id AND rc.status <> 'released'
          AND rc.family_id <> ?          -- exclude the caller's own row
      ), 0) <= ri.quantity_wanted
ON CONFLICT (item_id, family_id) DO UPDATE SET …
RETURNING id
```

Two details are load-bearing:

- **`rc.family_id <> ?` excludes the caller's own row**, so a household raising its own quantity is measured against *other* households' claims. That is what lets one statement serve both the first claim and a later change, via the `ON CONFLICT` arm.
- **Success is decided by `RETURNING`**, never by re-reading the `(item_id, family_id)` pair. A household that had *released* this item still has a row there, so the re-read would report success for a claim the guard refused. There is a test named for exactly this.

Zero rows returned means one of two things; only that failure path pays for a second query to tell `ItemFullyClaimed` (409) from `RegistryItemNotInWedding` (404).

**Timestamps.** This statement writes `created_at` / `updated_at` directly rather than through a Date-valued insert, so it must match drizzle's `integer({ mode: "timestamp" })` unit — **epoch seconds, not milliseconds**. Getting it wrong still writes the row, just dated to the year 58000, so `toEpochSeconds` is pinned by a test against what a normal drizzle insert produces.

---

## API

All organiser routes sit under `/api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/registry`, gated `osnAuth()` → role gate → **`weddingEntitlement(db, "registry")`** → rate limiter. Ordering matters: a stranger gets 403 from the role gate *before* the entitlement gate runs, so a 402 never leaks which weddings exist or which features they hold.

| Route | Gate |
|---|---|
| `GET /registry` — settings + items (with claim counts) + gift log | `weddingMember` |
| `PUT /registry/settings` | `weddingEditor` |
| `POST /registry/items`, `PATCH /registry/items/reorder`, `PATCH \| DELETE /registry/items/:itemId` | `weddingEditor` |
| `POST /registry/gifts/:kind/:giftId/thanked` | `weddingEditor` |
| `POST /registry/link-preview` | `weddingEditor` + **its own** per-organiser limiter — see [Link preview](#link-preview) |
| `POST /registry/image` (raw bytes), `POST /registry/image/from-url` | `weddingEditor` + **their own** 10-a-minute limiter — see [Picking one](#picking-one-we-copy-the-bytes-we-never-store-the-url) |
| `GET /registry/image/:name` — serves our R2 copy, `private` | `weddingMember` |

`/registry/items/reorder` is registered **before** `/registry/items/:itemId` so the literal wins over the param. `:kind` is decoded through the same Effect Schema a body field would be — an unknown value 400s rather than falling through to a table by coincidence.

### Bounded reads

`GET /registry` returns the settings, every item, and a **page** of the gift log — never the whole log. A wedding with 300 guests can produce a four-figure gift log, and one unbounded read of it on every portal page load is the shape that turns a free-tier D1 read budget into an outage.

- **50 gifts a page** (`GIFT_LOG_PAGE`), with `?giftsOffset=` walking it and **`giftsHasMore`** in the response telling the portal whether to draw a "load more". An unparseable, negative or absurd offset reads as 0 rather than 400ing — a junk query string is a broken link, not an attack worth a status code.
- **The offset is capped** (`MAX_GIFT_LOG_OFFSET` = 500). Paging is offset-based, not keyset, because the log merges two tables whose timestamps are second-granular and share no id order; a cap is what keeps the cost of the deepest page bounded.
- **Totals are computed in SQL, not from the page.** `contributionsPrimaryMinor` is a `sum()` over every `succeeded` contribution. Summing the page instead would under-report the couple's money the moment the log passed 50 entries — silently, and in the direction that looks like a missing gift.
- **500 items a wedding** (`MAX_ITEMS_PER_WEDDING`) — `POST /registry/items` answers **409 `registry_item_limit_reached`** past it. The ceiling is per wedding, not per account.

`PUT /registry/settings` refuses `cashGiftsEnabled: true` with **409 `stripe_not_ready`** unless the wedding's Connect account can actually take charges. Offering a contribute button that 503s is worse than offering none, because the guest believes they paid.

### External URLs

`external_url` must be an absolute `https:` URL, checked at the boundary by parsing it — not by shape-matching. It reaches an `<a href>` on the guest site, and an unvalidated URL there is a same-origin script sink; the precedent is **CON-S-L2**, where `vendor.privacyUrl` reached an `href` with no scheme check. The guest renderer re-checks rather than trusting the column, because a row can also arrive from a migration or a fixture.

The parse also **rejects embedded credentials** (`https://evil.com@retailer.example/…`, which reads as the retailer to a guest and resolves to `evil.com` to the browser) and **stores the parsed `URL.href`**, not the raw input — so what the column holds is the normalised form the browser would resolve, and two spellings of the same URL can't diverge between the check and the render.

`shipping_visible_from` is a calendar date, and its schema round-trips the string through a real `Date` rather than shape-matching `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}`: `2026-02-30` matches the shape and is not a day.

### Images

Registry images are **always our own copy in R2**, through the existing invite-assets pipeline. Never hotlink a retailer image: an off-origin `img-src` breaks the guest site's CSP and would need a vendor entry in the [[cire-consent]] registry. How the bytes get there — upload or picked shop link — is [Picking one](#picking-one-we-copy-the-bytes-we-never-store-the-url) below.

**An `imageKey` must name this wedding's own upload.** Keys are `assets/<weddingId>/<name>`, so an editor on wedding A could otherwise set an item's image to `assets/<weddingB>/hero` and read a private photo out of a wedding they have no role on — an object-reference hole, not a validation nicety. Both `POST /registry/items` and `PATCH /registry/items/:itemId` compare the key's wedding segment against the route's `:weddingId` and answer **400 `image_key_not_in_wedding`** otherwise. The schema separately pins the key's *shape* — `assets/<segment>/registry-<name>`, no dots, no traversal — so a malformed key 400s before the ownership check ever runs; the two guards answer different questions and both are wanted.

**The shape check also pins the `registry-` prefix, which is what keeps the wedding's own invite photos out of reach.** Without it, an editor could point a registry item at `assets/<thisWedding>/hero-<uuid>` — their own wedding, so the ownership check passes — and the item would serve the invite's hero through the registry route, which sits behind a different gate and answers `private` rather than the invite route's public cache. Worse, deleting the item would reap the hero out of R2. Only keys minted by `storeAsset` for a registry save carry the prefix, so the schema, `imageKeyBelongsTo` and the reap all agree on which objects this module owns. The pattern is defined **once**, beside the minting function in `services/invite-assets.ts` (`REGISTRY_IMAGE_NAME` / `REGISTRY_IMAGE_KEY`), and imported by the schema and the service — three hand-copied regexes were the first version and would have drifted.

---

## Link preview

`POST /api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/registry/link-preview` takes `{ url }` and answers `{ title, siteName, images: string[] }` — up to six candidate image URLs for the item picker. The organiser pastes a shop link; we fetch the page, read its tags, and hand back what they can choose from.

**This is the most dangerous module in `cire/api`, and the only one of its kind.** Every other outbound fetch we make goes to a host *we* chose — the OSN issuer, Resend, Stripe, Pinterest. This one goes wherever a caller's URL points, which is the textbook definition of a server-side request forgery sink: the Worker sits in a network position the caller does not have, so "fetch this for me" is a request to borrow it. [`pinterest-resolve.ts`](../../cire/api/src/services/pinterest-resolve.ts)'s answer is a host **allowlist**, which is correct when there is exactly one destination and impossible when the destination is any shop on the internet. So the guard has a different shape.

### Five layers

Implemented in `cire/api/src/services/link-preview.ts`. All must pass, and the first three re-run on **every redirect hop**:

1. **Scheme.** `https:` only. `http:`, `data:`, `file:`, `javascript:`, `ftp:` — refused before a socket exists. Embedded credentials refused too, same reasoning as `external_url` above. Checked twice: once at the HTTP boundary by reusing the `HttpsUrl` schema, and again inside the service, because a `Location` header never passes through a schema.
2. **Destination address.** A literal-IP host is range-checked arithmetically with **no DNS round trip**. A named host is resolved over DNS-over-HTTPS (`cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query`, A + AAAA) and every answer is range-checked; **any** non-public answer rejects the whole URL, and a name that resolves to nothing is rejected too. Blocked ranges: `0.0.0.0/8`, `10/8`, `127/8`, `100.64/10` (CGNAT), `169.254/16` (cloud metadata), `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `224/4` and above, `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`, `ff00::/8`. IPv4-mapped (`::ffff:a.b.c.d`), IPv4-compatible and NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`) addresses are **unwrapped and re-checked against the v4 rules** — otherwise every private range above is reachable by spelling it in IPv6. An address we cannot parse counts as blocked; the v4 parser is strict about leading zeros (`0177.0.0.1` is octal loopback to some resolvers and decimal to others — a parser differential).
3. **Manual redirects.** `redirect: "manual"`, capped at 3 hops, layers 1 and 2 re-run on each hop's `Location` **before** the next fetch. Without this a benign first host can 302 us to `http://169.254.169.254/` and the platform's own redirect follower goes happily. Falling out of the cap is `too_many_redirects`, not a loop.
4. **Caps.** One `AbortSignal.timeout` budget (5s) across *all* hops — three hosts each answering just inside a per-hop timeout must not add up to 15s of a Worker's wall clock. A 512 KB body cap read **off the stream**, cancelling the reader past it, because `Content-Length` is a claim by the same server that would lie about it. `Content-Type` must start with `text/html`.
5. **The candidates we emit.** Absolute-ised against the **final** document URL (not the input URL — a shortener's redirect changes what a relative `src` means), `https:` only, each image host run through layer 2 as well. We do not fetch those URLs, the organiser's browser does — but a `javascript:` or `data:` src must never reach a picker that will put it in an `<img>`.

### The known gap

**The DoH check is TOCTOU-imperfect and cannot be made otherwise on this runtime.** We resolve the name, decide, then hand the **name** to `fetch`, which resolves it again; an attacker who controls the zone can answer differently the second time. Closing that needs a connect-time hook — resolve once, connect to the address we vetted — and workerd exposes none: no socket API under `fetch`, no `lookup` callback, no "pin this address" option. This stops every static private-IP target, every redirect into one, and every host that simply resolves inward. It does not stop a DNS-rebinding attacker. Tracked as **S-M1** in `wiki/todo/security.md`.

### Rate limit

Its own per-organiser limiter, **10 requests a minute**, keyed on `osnProfileId` — not the limiter the registry writes use. One authenticated request costs a full page fetch to a host the caller named, so it is an amplifier, and an Elysia guard applies to every route in its group. That is why it is a third route factory (`createRegistryLinkPreviewRoutes`) rather than another handler on the write group; same split, same reason, as `routes/organiser-enquiries.ts`. Gate order is the write routes' order with the limiter appended: `osnAuth` (401) → `weddingEditor` (403) → `weddingEntitlement` (402) → limiter (429). The limiter is **last** so a wedding without the entitlement is turned away before it can spend anyone's budget.

### Parsing

A commented regex scan, not `HTMLRewriter`. workerd has `HTMLRewriter`; Bun, where the tests run, does not — and a parser that only runs in production is a parser nothing tests. The scan reads `<meta>`, `<link rel="image_src">`, `<img>` and `<title>` only, executes nothing, and its output is untrusted text: a hostile page can at worst make us emit a URL, which layer 5 then re-checks. Ranking is `og:image`/`twitter:image` first, then `image_src`, then `<img>` in document order with anything declaring itself under 100px dropped (icons, sprites, trackers). No new dependency.

**Every pattern in the scan excludes `<` and `>` inside the tag it matches.** A tag regex written the obvious way — `<meta\s[^>]*>` with a nested quoted-attribute alternation, or `<title.*?>` — backtracks quadratically on input that opens thousands of tags and closes none, which is a single 512 KB request away and would burn the whole 10ms CPU budget on a free-tier Worker. The exclusions make each match linear and self-terminating: the scan cannot run past the next `<`. The cost is that an attribute value containing a literal `<` ends the match early, which loses that one tag; the page is a stranger's HTML and the output is six candidate URLs, so losing a malformed tag is not a loss worth a backtracking hazard. Tests flood the scanner with each of the three shapes at the cap and assert wall-clock, so a "tidier" regex cannot quietly reintroduce it.

**Rank-2 (`<img>`) collection stops at 32 candidates**, since only six are ever emitted and a catalogue page carries hundreds. Ordering is untouched by the cap — the sort is stable and the emit loop is unchanged.

**Distinct candidate hosts are resolved at the same time, not one after another.** Layer 5 re-checks every emitted URL, so a page listing six images on six CDNs used to cost six sequential DoH round-trips inside the same 5s budget the page fetch already spent from. The hosts are deduped against the guard's memo, checked with one `Promise.all`, and only then does the ranked list get walked in its original order — the walk reads the memo, so what it emits and in what order is exactly what it emitted before. **Redirect hops stay sequential**: hop *n+1* is not known until hop *n* answers, and each one must be vetted before it is followed. The DoH lookups also carry the operation's own signal (`AbortSignal.any([signal, AbortSignal.timeout(2000)])`), so a lookup started near the end of the budget is cancelled with everything else rather than running past it.

### Errors

Tagged classes, mapped by the route. None is a 500 — every failure here is the caller's or the internet's problem:

| Error | Status | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `LinkPreviewBlocked` | 400 | `blocked_url` |
| `LinkPreviewFetchFailed` | 502 | `preview_fetch_failed` |
| `LinkPreviewUnusableContent` | 415 | `unsupported_content_type` |
| `LinkPreviewNoImages` | 422 | `no_images_found` |

**`blocked_url` deliberately carries no reason.** It tells the organiser to check their link; telling them *which* rule fired would turn this endpoint into a network scanner with a clean oracle — `private_address` vs `unresolvable` maps internal ranges one query at a time. The reason goes to the log instead, where only we can read it: `private_address` at ERROR (someone pointed us inward), everything else at WARNING. Log annotations are bounded strings only — never the URL, never the resolved address, never anything the organiser typed.

`counter cire.registry.link_preview` carries one attribute, `result` ∈ `ok | blocked | fetch_failed | unusable_content | no_images`.

Both seams — `fetchImpl` and `resolveHost` — are injectable, so `services/link-preview.test.ts` and the route tests touch no network at all.

### Picking one: we copy the bytes, we never store the URL

Preview hands back candidate URLs. The moment an organiser picks one, `POST /api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/registry/image/from-url` **downloads it and writes our own copy to R2**, and the item stores that R2 key. The shop's URL is not stored anywhere — not on the item, not in a column, not in the response.

That is a deliberate refusal, and the reasons are ordered by how badly each one bites:

- **The bytes can change after the organiser approved them.** They saw a stand mixer; the shop can serve anything at that URL a month later, on a page couples send to everyone they know. Nothing about the preview binds what was shown to what is served.
- **It rots.** Retailer CDNs re-slug on every catalogue change, and a delisted product takes its image with it. A wedding page is read for months after it is built.
- **It leaks the guest.** Every guest loading the list would make a request to the shop carrying their IP and our referrer — a third-party disclosure nobody consented to, and a vendor entry we would owe the [[cire-consent]] registry.
- **We vetted the host for its IP range and nothing else.** That is enough to refuse an SSRF target; it is not a claim that the host is trustworthy for the lifetime of the page.

Two endpoints, both on the write group's gates (`osnAuth` 401 → `weddingEditor` 403 → `weddingEntitlement` 402) with their own 10-a-minute per-organiser limiter appended (`defaultRegistryImageLimiter` — a save costs an outbound fetch and an R2 write):

| Route | Body | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `POST .../registry/image` | raw image bytes | `{ imageKey, imageUrl, contentType, byteLength }` |
| `POST .../registry/image/from-url` | `{ url }` | the same |

`services/registry-image.ts` is what both call, and it treats the URL in that body as **fully untrusted even though we emitted it** — the request body is client-controlled, so a client can post any URL to this endpoint, and the emitted candidate has no standing at all. It reuses `link-preview.ts`'s guard — `createUrlGuard` + `checkUrl` + `guardedFetch` + `readCappedBytes`, the same functions the preview path runs — not a second copy of it: same scheme rule, same DoH range check, same manual redirects, same 5s budget. Then, on the bytes:

1. `Content-Length`, if present, over 5 MB → refused before reading. A claim by the sender, so it is a shortcut, never the check.
2. The **real** read length over 5 MB → refused mid-stream, reader cancelled.
3. `detectImageType` on the leading bytes. **The `Content-Type` header is not consulted for the decision** — a server that answers `image/png` over an HTML page is the ordinary case here, not an exotic one, and the stored object's type is the sniffed one. Anything outside `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp` is refused.
4. `storeAsset` writes `assets/<weddingId>/registry-<uuid>` — the same pipeline, key shape and bucket as invite hero images, so `imageKeyBelongsTo` and the reconciler already understand it.

Serving is the existing gated route, `GET .../registry/image/:name`, through the Cloudflare Images transform binding: the key is **rebuilt server-side** from the route's `:weddingId` (the client's `:name` is charset-pinned and never a path), the cache version comes from `versionFromKey`, not the client's `?v=`, and the response is `private` — unlike the public invite image route, because this one sits behind an organiser session. That is why the portal's thumbnail goes through `authFetch` into an object URL rather than a bare `<img src>`, and why it asks for `?variant=thumb` (320px) rather than the 800px `card` default — the field paints it at 80px.

The transform caches through the Cloudflare Cache API under a synthetic key. A `private` response is not something the platform cache is obliged to store, so the copy handed to `cache.put` carries `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` and the copy returned to the browser is re-stamped with the route's own visibility on both the miss and the hit path — the synthetic key is unreachable from outside and the lookup happens after the gates, so `public` on the stored copy never reaches a client. This is unverified against a live Worker; see the open **P-W2** in `wiki/todo/perf.md`.

Errors: `blocked_url` 400 (same opaque code, same no-reason rule as preview), `image_fetch_failed` 502, `unsupported_image_type` 415, `image_too_large` 413.

**Nothing leaks on delete, and nothing is reaped out from under a second item.** Two items can hold the same key — an organiser duplicating a row, or two saves of the same picked picture — so the delete counts the remaining holders of that key **in the same step as the delete**, and only reaps when the count is zero. Counting later would race the next delete. The reap itself runs after the response, through `getWaitUntil(request)`, because R2 latency is not something the organiser should wait on; outside a Worker (unit tests, the Bun local entry) there is no `waitUntil`, so it falls back to an inline await and behaves identically, just slower. `asset-reconcile.ts` counts `registry_items.image_key` as a live reference, so a picture saved into an add form the organiser then abandoned — the form has no item id to hang it off, so the save happens first — is swept once it is past the grace window instead of sitting in the bucket forever.

This is what closed **S-L2** in `wiki/todo/security.md`.

## Organiser surface (`@cire/host`)

The module lives at `cire/host/src/components/RegistryView.tsx`, wired into the rail by `lib/module-nav.ts`, into the route grammar by `lib/dashboard-route.ts` (`MODULE_SUBS.registry = ["list", "gifts"]`) and into the shell by `components/ModuleShell.tsx`. Both sub-tabs mount the **same** component with a `view` prop — one fetch, one cache, two renders.

**The upsell is the normal state.** The shell wraps the module in `<Show when={entitlements.includes("registry")} fallback={<UpsellPanel feature="registry" />}>`, exactly as vendors does. No wedding holds the entitlement, so an organiser navigating to Registry today sees the panel, and the module below it is code nobody can reach without a comp grant.

**No Overview card.** The obvious "gifts received" tile would fire a guaranteed-402 request on the most-loaded page in the portal, for every wedding, forever, to render nothing. It lands with the entitlement, not before.

**`lib/registry-store.ts`** is the vendors snapshot cache in the same shape: one `GET /registry` per wedding, an inflight map so two mounts share a request, and `invalidateRegistry` on any write. Writes mutate the cached snapshot rather than refetching, which is what makes the reorder and the thank-you toggle feel instant.

**Reorder is buttons, not drag.** ↑/↓ per row, optimistic splice, then `PATCH .../items/reorder` with the full `orderedIds`. A gift list only a mouse can reorder is not one everyone can reorder — which used to make drag expensive here, because the old library supplied no keyboard path. `@shared/sortable`'s `createSortableList` now does (see [[drag-and-drop]]), so adopting drag is a UX decision rather than an accessibility project. Note REG-P-W1 if you take it on: reordering must rewrite only the rows whose position changed, or all up-to-500 rows tear down and an open inline editor loses its caret.

**Money in the UI.** Prices are authored in `weddings.currency` and parsed by `parseMinor` (`lib/money.ts`), which rounds to the currency's own exponent; `minorToInput` is its inverse for seeding the edit form. Both price inputs use `step="any"` deliberately — `step="0.01"` makes a valid three-decimal KWD price a constraint violation the browser refuses before any handler runs. A foreign-currency gift renders **as given** as the headline with the snapshotted primary equivalent underneath, and `contributionsPrimaryMinor` is labelled approximate on screen, because it is a sum of per-day rates and reading it as an exact balance is the mistake worth pre-empting.

**S-L3 — the gift log renders three guest-authored fields.** `note`, `displayName` and the household's `familyName` all come from people we do not control, and all three go through Solid's `{expr}` interpolation and nothing else: no `innerHTML`, no markdown renderer, no rich text anywhere on this path. If a future PR wants formatted notes, it needs a sanitiser and a review, not a renderer. Pinned by `renders a script-shaped note, display name and family name as literal text (S-L3)` in `RegistryView.test.tsx`, which asserts the payload appears as text *and* that no `script`, `img` or `b` element exists in the container.

**The picture field** is `components/RegistryImageField.tsx`, mounted in both the add form and the inline editor, and it matches `invite/ImageField.tsx` in structure, error surface and accessibility handling. Two divergences, both forced: the thumbnail is `authFetch`ed into an object URL (the registry serve route is gated and `private`, so a bare `src` would 401), and the link path offers a **choice** rather than taking the first candidate — a radio group with roving tabindex, arrow/Home/End keys, and an accessible name built from the page's own title rather than "image 1". `ImageCropModal` is deliberately **not** reused: it is slot-typed to the invite's `CropSlot`s and reads `CROP_ASPECT[slot]`, and registry items have no crop slot.

Candidates are filtered to `https:` **again in the browser** before any of them becomes an `<img src>`, and the pick is re-checked before it is posted. The API emits nothing else, but a render site that trusts its input because of what the server promised is one API change away from being wrong. "No pictures on that page" (422) is a normal outcome, not an error: it renders as a note that offers the upload path, not an alert.

**Not built yet on this surface:** the settings form (publish toggle, shipping address, cash gifts).

## Guest surface (`@cire/invites`)

**The list has its own page: `/<slug>/registry`.** It used to be the last section of the invite. It is the one part of an invitation a guest comes *back* to — to see what is left, to change what they reserved, to open it in a shop — and none of that should mean scrolling the invitation again. It is also a link a couple can send on its own.

`src/lib/gift-registry.ts` is the client; `src/components/gift-registry/` is the UI:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `GiftRegistryDocument.astro` | The page shell: masthead, sticky return rail, footer, consent |
| `GiftRegistryPage.tsx` | The page body — both reads, every write, the shelves |
| `GiftRegistryItemCard.tsx` | One gift, with its own claim form |
| `GiftRegistryTeaser.tsx` | The band left behind on the invite, linking to the page |

`src/pages/[slug]/registry.astro` is the route. It runs the invite read and the list read **in parallel** (they are independent, and a guest waits for the slower, not the sum), then renders the shell with both. Both design packs mount the *teaser* from `Document.astro` as a `client:visible={{ rootMargin: "600px" }}` island between `<InvitePage>` and `<SiteFooter>`, where the section used to sit.

**One shell, not one per design pack.** The packs differ in the invite's own structure; the gift list never has — it was one shared component in both, and its surface comes from the same derived palette, fonts and section tone every other section reads. If a pack ever forks the gift surfaces, the shell takes the pack as a prop rather than being duplicated.

**What each failure means at the route.** The public read answers one 404 code for "no registry", "not entitled" and "not published", so all three are the same 404 page with the same words — the route must not become the thing that tells them apart. An unreachable API is a **503**, not a 404: the list may be fine, and "no gift list here" would be a lie a retry disproves. A failed *invite* read still renders the page, with the built-in theme and copy — the list is what the page is for. Pinned by `pages/[slug]/registry.test.ts`, a source-text guard in the shape of `pages/index.test.ts`.

**It is still its own island, and still public.** The public read is unauthenticated and `InvitePage`'s body is gated on a claim, so neither the teaser nor the page may live inside it. A signed-out guest sees the gifts and a line pointing at **the invitation** — a link now, since the code form is in another document — never a button that can only 401.

**Counts, never names.** The card renders `giftRegistryRemainingCopy` ("1 of 2 left", "All reserved") and, for a taken item, "Another guest has this one covered." The only name on the page is this household's own `displayName`, read from the credentialed `…/registry/mine` route and echoed back to the people who typed it. Notes are never rendered at all — they are addressed to the couple. Pinned by tests in both component files that assert no `reserved by`-shaped text and no claimant identity in the DOM.

**No optimistic update anywhere, on purpose.** Every count a guest reads came from a read the server had just answered. A claim that returns 409 `item_fully_claimed` refetches **both** reads, then says: *"Another guest reserved the last "X" a moment ago. The list below is up to date."* — and leaves the guest's form open with what they typed still in it. `applyOutcome` is the single place that decides what a write means: `ok` / `fully-claimed` / `item-gone` re-read both, `hidden` re-reads the list (which then 404s, and the page says the couple have closed their list, with a link back to the invitation), `signed-out` drops to the signed-out surface, and rate-limited / invalid / transport errors re-read nothing because nothing moved.

**The list is keyed by id, not by item — and the shelves by category string.** `<For>` reconciles by reference and every refetch parses fresh objects, so iterating the items would dispose and re-create every row on each re-read — throwing away the open claim form at precisely the moment the 409 path re-reads in order to show the new counts *beside* the words the guest just wrote. Rows iterate ids and look the item up in `itemsById()`; shelves iterate `groupKeys()` (the category string, `null` for the unlabelled tail — both primitives that compare equal) and look the group up in `groupsByKey()`. Keying the shelves on the rebuilt group objects would take every open form under them down with the shelf.

**Shelves are the couple's own categories.** `groupGiftRegistryItems` keeps them in the order the list already carries (first mention wins — nothing is alphabetised behind their back), trims them so one spelling is one shelf, and puts everything ungrouped in one tail last, under "More gifts". When they grouped nothing, `hasGiftRegistryCategories` is false and no label is painted at all: one unlabelled shelf is a plain list, and heading it would name a distinction they never made.

**The ledger line** above the list is what a page can say that a section could not: `giftRegistryAvailabilityCopy` ("6 of 14 still available", "Every gift has been reserved") on the left, and this household's own `giftRegistryClaimedCopy` ("You reserved 2 gifts") on the right when it has any. Counts only, same rule as the cards, and quantities rather than rows — one row for six glasses is six gifts to a guest. An empty list gets its own copy instead, never "0 of 0".

**The reserve ceiling is not `remaining`.** The server's claim is an upsert whose availability guard excludes the caller's own row, so a household may raise its own reservation to `remaining + ownClaim.quantity` (capped at 99). A household holding both of two copies still sees a Change control, not a dead card.

**`external_url` is re-checked at the render site.** `giftRegistryExternalHref` re-parses the column and returns `null` for anything that is not `https:` (and for embedded credentials), so a non-https value renders no link at all rather than an `<a href>`; the link carries `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`. Same reasoning as **CON-S-L2** and as the organiser-side re-filter: a render site that trusts its input because of what the server promised is one API change away from being wrong.

**Reads.** The public list read is uncredentialed and `no-store`. The household read passes `credentials: "include"` — the guest cookie is host-scoped to the API origin, which is a different origin from the guest site, and a cross-origin fetch on the default `same-origin` mode drops it silently. It is also gated on the `cire_claimed` hint cookie (`hasClaimedHint`, exported from `claim-session.ts`): both surfaces are public and shareable, so an unconditional `…/registry/mine` would spend a guaranteed 401 **per page view** rather than per guest, against an account-wide Workers Free budget.

**The page is seeded by the server, and a failed re-read leaves what is on screen.** The route already fetched the list to decide the page exists, so it hands it to the island as `initialRegistry` and the first paint is the real list — no hydrate-then-fetch waterfall for someone opening the link in a shop. The island still re-reads on mount (both sides are `no-store`; a tab left open in a shop must not act on stale counts), but only an answer replaces what is rendered: `ok` swaps the list, `hidden` closes it, and a transport failure changes nothing. As a band at the foot of the invite, blanking on a blip cost a section nobody had scrolled to; on a page it would blank the page under someone reading it.

**States that look alike and are not.** An unpublished or unentitled registry 404s: the *page* is a 404 and the teaser renders nothing at all on the invite. A published empty one renders its masthead and "The couple haven't added any gifts yet." The shipping address renders only when the household read actually returned one — the field is optional on the wire and carries no reason, so absent covers both "the couple set none" and "you may not see it", and there is nothing honest to print in its place.

**Copy and theme.** `registry_*` copy columns reach both surfaces as `eyebrow` / `heading` / `body`; `null` means the built-in default (`With Love` / `Gift Registry`), the same contract as the details section. Where both exist, the invite's own section copy wins over the registry module's `headline` / `message`, because it is section furniture themed with every other header. Resolution is pure (`giftRegistryEyebrow` / `giftRegistryHeading` / `giftRegistryBody`) so the Astro shell can render the masthead server-side, and **blank counts as unset** — the old `??` chain let a heading saved as `""` beat both fallbacks, which on a page of its own is an empty browser tab. `ThemeSection` carries `"registry"`, so both surfaces take a tone through the same `sectionVars` allow-list as the rest, and the page's masthead reuses the invite hero's own server-blurred `hero-bg` variant at the same URL — already in cache for a guest who came from the invitation — with the organiser's crop honoured through `heroCropLayers`.

**The way back stays put.** The rail is `position: sticky` with its own `Z_LAYER.STICKY_RAIL` (20): every card below it paints a background and sits later in the document, so without a layer the rail is painted over by the list the moment it starts to matter.

**Status is a live region at the page root**, never an overlay: this section sits among animated ones and any ancestor `transform` traps `position: fixed`. The claim form is inline in the card for the same reason.

**`kind: "cash_fund"` is not special-cased.** It renders like any other item. Contributions land with Stripe Connect; a contribute flow over a backend that cannot take a charge would be UI standing in for something that does not exist.

**Not built here:** contributions, and any surface for a claim's `status` beyond `reserved`.

## Observability

`cire.registry.item.write` (attribute: `action` = create/update/remove) and `cire.registry.gift` (attribute: `action` = thanked/unthanked). Both are attributed by action only — no `weddingId`, `itemId` or `familyId` ever reaches a metric attribute; those belong in spans and logs.

Every handler runs `Effect.tapDefect` before its catch-all, so a defect is **logged** (`registry handler defect`, annotated with `weddingId` alone) instead of being swallowed into a bare 500. `weddingId` alone is the point: a guest's note, display name or contribution message is PII and never reaches a log line, so the annotation is deliberately the one field that identifies the wedding and nothing that identifies a person.

---

## Naming hazard

`cire/invites/src/designs/registry.ts` is the **invite design-pack registry** — an unrelated use of the word that predates this module. Guest-site files for this feature use `gift-registry` to keep the two apart.

## Still to land

- Organiser settings form: the publish toggle, the shipping address, cash gifts — the three fields the guest surface already reads and cannot yet be set from the portal
- Stripe Connect (Express): onboarding, hosted Checkout, the webhook, and the balance-transaction FX capture described under [Money](#money)
