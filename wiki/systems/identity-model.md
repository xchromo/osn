# Identity Model

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning | Code entity |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **User** | The actual human person. Not a data structure — never a type name, column, or variable. | — |
| **Account** | Login identity — email, passkeys, auth tokens. A user owns one account. | `accounts` table, `acc_` prefix |
| **Profile** | Public-facing identity — handle, display name, avatar. An account can have multiple profiles. | `users` table (legacy name), `Profile` type, `usr_` prefix |
| **Organisation** | Group identity composed of profiles. | `organisations` table, `org_` prefix |

A user owns an account, which owns one or more profiles. The relationship is: **User (person) → Account (login) → Profiles (public identities)**.

OSN uses a two-tier identity model inspired by Meta's Accounts Center. A single **account** (the login entity) can own multiple **profiles** (the public-facing handles). **Organisations** are separate entities composed of individual profiles.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           accounts                  │  ← Login identity (invisible externally)
│  acc_xxxx | email | passkeyUserId   │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ 1:N (private link)
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│     users table (= profiles)        │  ← Public-facing identity / handle
│  usr_xxxx | accountId | handle | …  │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ (canonical entity everywhere)
               │
    ┌──────────┼──────────┐

## Accounts

The `accounts` table is the **authentication principal** — the entity that logs in, owns passkeys, and receives OTP/magic-link emails.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | `text PK` | `acc_` prefix + 12 hex chars |
| `email` | `text UNIQUE` | Login credential — the only place email lives |
| `passkeyUserId` | `text NOT NULL UNIQUE` | Random UUID used as WebAuthn `user.id` — opaque, non-correlating (P6) |
| `maxProfiles` | `integer` | Default 5; enforced by `createProfile` in P3 |
| `createdAt` | `timestamp` | |
| `updatedAt` | `timestamp` | |

**Key invariants:**
- `accountId` is **never exposed** in any API response, token claim, or log entry. It is the multi-account correlation identifier — leaking it reveals which profiles belong to the same person. Added to the log redaction deny-list in P6.
- `passkeyUserId` is a random UUID generated at account creation, used as the WebAuthn `user.id` in passkey registration. This prevents two profiles on the same account from being correlated via matching WebAuthn credential `user.id` fields. Lazy-filled for accounts created before P6.
- Email is **only on accounts**, not duplicated on profiles.
- Passkeys reference `accounts.id` (not profile IDs), because authentication is account-level.

## Profiles (DB table: `users`)

The `users` table is the **public-facing identity**. This is what other profiles see — a handle, display name, and avatar. Every reference across Pulse, Zap, and the social graph points to `users.id` (the `profileId`). Code-level functions and API parameters use `profile` terminology (e.g. `findProfileByHandle`, `registerProfile`, `blockProfile`); the DB table retains the name `users` for migration stability.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | `text PK` | `usr_` prefix + 12 hex chars |
| `accountId` | `text FK → accounts.id` | The owning login entity (never exposed) |
| `handle` | `text UNIQUE` | `@handle` — immutable social identity |
| `displayName` | `text` | Nullable display name |
| `avatarUrl` | `text` | Nullable avatar URL |
| `isDefault` | `boolean` | Exactly one per account; auto-selected on login |
| `createdAt` | `timestamp` | |
| `updatedAt` | `timestamp` | |

**Key invariants:**
- `profileId` (previously `userId`) is the canonical identifier throughout all services. Pulse events, Zap chats, RSVPs, connections, blocks — everything keys on `profileId`. All service functions, route parameters, and error messages use "profile" terminology (not "user").
- Each profile has a **fully independent social graph**. If profile A blocks someone, profile B (same account) is NOT affected.
- Two profiles from the same account **can interact** — they can connect, message, RSVP to the same event. Preventing this would reveal the account link.
- Handle namespace is **shared with organisations** — no user handle can collide with an org handle.

## Organisations

Organisations are independent entities that are **composed of profiles, not accounts**. An org member is a handle/profile. The system cannot distinguish whether two members in the same org share an account.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | `text PK` | `org_` prefix |
| `handle` | `text UNIQUE` | Shared namespace with user handles |
| `name` | `text` | Display name |
| `ownerId` | `text FK → users.id` | A profile, not an account |

### Organisation Members

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | `text PK` | `orgm_` prefix |
| `organisationId` | `text FK → organisations.id` | |
| `profileId` | `text FK → users.id` | The member's profile |
| `role` | `admin \| member` | |

**Key invariants:**
- Multiple profiles from the same account **can be in the same org** — one might be admin, another a member. This is by design.
- Org ownership is per-profile. Deleting a profile that owns an org requires ownership transfer first (enforced in P3).
- The `listMembers` service return **never includes `accountId`** — defence in depth against correlation leakage.

## Token Model

| Token | Bound to | Format | TTL | Purpose |
|-------|----------|--------|-----|---------|
| Access | Profile | ES256 JWT (`sub` = profileId) | **5 min** | Authorize API calls as a specific profile |
| Session (refresh) | Account | Opaque `ses_` + 40 hex chars (160-bit entropy) | 30 days (sliding) | Re-issue access tokens; enables profile switching without re-authentication |
| Enrollment | Account | ES256 JWT (`sub` = accountId) | 5 min | Passkey registration after signup |
| Recovery code | Account | 16 hex chars `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` (64-bit entropy) | No expiry, single-use | Lost-device account recovery (Copenhagen Book M2) — see [[recovery-codes]] |

Access tokens live in `localStorage` and are the only auth secret there after C3. A 5-minute TTL caps the XSS blast radius — the companion change is client `authFetch` silent-refresh on 401 via the HttpOnly refresh cookie. Third-party OAuth clients receive `expires_in: 300` in the `/token` response.

### Server-side sessions (Copenhagen Book C1)

Session tokens (formerly "refresh tokens") are **opaque** — not JWTs. The server stores only the **SHA-256 hash** of each token in the `sessions` table. A database leak does not expose valid tokens because the tokens have 160 bits of entropy.

**Sliding-window expiry:** when less than half the TTL remains (< 15 days), the session's `expiresAt` is extended by the full TTL from now. This matches the Copenhagen Book's recommended pattern.

**Revocation:** `invalidateSession(token)` deletes a single session row; `invalidateAccountSessions(accountId)` deletes all sessions for an account (used for security events). `POST /logout` exposes single-session invalidation.

**Sessions table:**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | `text PK` | SHA-256(raw token), hex-encoded |
| `account_id` | `text FK → accounts.id` | The owning account |
| `expires_at` | `integer` | Unix seconds |
| `created_at` | `integer` | Unix seconds |

Two profile management endpoints:
- `POST /profiles/switch` — present the session token + target `profileId` in the request body; receive a new access token for that profile. Per-account rate limited (20 switches/hr).
- `POST /profiles/list` — present the session token in the request body; receive all profiles for the account. Session tokens are never sent via `Authorization` headers to avoid conflation with access tokens.

## Client Storage Model (P4)

`@osn/client` stores the multi-profile session under a single `localStorage` key:

| Key | Shape | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `@osn/client:account_session` | `AccountSession` JSON | Refresh token, active profile ID, per-profile access tokens, scopes, ID token |

The `AccountSession` structure:

```typescript
interface AccountSession {
  refreshToken: string;           // Account-scoped (shared across profiles)
  activeProfileId: string;        // Currently active profile
  profileTokens: Record<string, ProfileToken>;  // Per-profile access tokens
  scopes: string[];
  idToken: string | null;
}
```

**Design decisions:**
- Single-key storage (not multi-key) avoids the need for `keys()` enumeration on logout and simplifies atomic writes.
- Expired profile tokens are pruned on every `saveAccountSession` call (except the active profile's token, which is kept for identity tracking).
- An in-memory cache avoids redundant `localStorage.getItem` + `JSON.parse` round-trips within the same service instance.
- All storage reads are validated against Effect Schema (`decodeAccountSession`) — malformed data is discarded rather than consumed.
- Legacy sessions (pre-P4, stored under `@osn/client:session`) are migrated transparently on the first `getSession()` call.

## Registration Flow

```
POST /register/begin  → email + handle + displayName → OTP sent
POST /register/complete → OTP →
  1. Creates account (acc_*) with email
  2. Creates profile (usr_*) with accountId, handle (in a transaction)
  3. Issues access + refresh tokens scoped to the profile
  4. Issues enrollment token scoped to the account (for passkey setup)
```

## Cross-Service Impact

| Service | References | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Pulse events | `createdByProfileId` | Profile that created the event |
| Pulse RSVPs | `profileId` | Profile that RSVP'd |
| Zap chats | `createdByProfileId`, member `profileId` | Profiles in the chat |
| Social graph | `requesterId`, `addresseeId` (both profile IDs) | Independent per profile |
| ARC S2S | No profile context | Service-to-service only |
| Login response | `{ session, profile: PublicProfile }` | Wire format + SDK types renamed to match identity model |

## Privacy Rules

1. **`accountId` never appears in**: API responses, JWT claims (except refresh/enrollment tokens, which are only seen by the account holder), log entries (enforced via redaction deny-list), metric attributes, span attributes, or any data sent to other services.
2. **`passkeyUserId` (not `accountId`)** is used as the WebAuthn `user.id` to prevent passkey-based profile correlation.
3. **Rate limiting is per-profile** for API calls, **per-IP for auth** — per-account rate limits would correlate profiles. Exception: profile-switch rate limiting is per-account (acceptable because the endpoint inherently requires the account-scoped refresh token).
4. **Block independence** — blocking on one profile does NOT affect other profiles on the same account.
5. **Self-interaction allowed** — two profiles from the same account can follow, message, and interact. Preventing this would reveal the link.
6. **Log redaction** — `accountId` and `account_id` are in the observability deny-list (`shared/observability/src/logger/redact.ts`) as defence in depth.

## Passkey Management (M-PK)

Settings-surface operations over an account's existing credentials. All routes bearer-authenticated; `DELETE` additionally gated by a fresh step-up token (passkey or OTP amr).

| Endpoint | Purpose | Step-up required? |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `GET /passkeys` | List credentials with label / created / last-used / backup-eligible flags | No |
| `PATCH /passkeys/:id` | Rename (label-only, 1–64 chars trimmed) | No |
| `DELETE /passkeys/:id` | Remove + invalidate other sessions (H1) + write `security_events{kind: "passkey_delete"}` (M-PK1b) | **Yes** |

### Schema columns (added 2026-04-22, migration `0007_passkey_management.sql`)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `label` | `text` | User-editable friendly name. NULL → UI falls back to synced/device heuristic |
| `last_used_at` | `integer` | Unix seconds. Coalesced to 60s on assertion / step-up (P-W4) |
| `aaguid` | `text` | Authenticator model UUID from WebAuthn attestation |
| `backup_eligible` / `backup_state` | `integer` 0/1 | WebAuthn sync-capable / synced flags |
| `updated_at` | `integer` | Unix seconds for any metadata change (rename, counter bump) |

### Enrolment hardening

- `residentKey: "required"` — discoverable-credential / conditional-UI login is mandatory.
- `userVerification: "required"` — biometric or PIN, never silent sign-in.
- `maxPasskeys = 10` per account (P-I10), enforced at `begin` and re-checked race-safely at `complete`.

### Discoverable-credential login

`POST /login/passkey/begin` with no body (or `{}`) returns `{ options, challengeId }`. Browser calls `navigator.credentials.get({ mediation: "conditional", … })`; the signed assertion is posted back via `/login/passkey/complete` with `{ challengeId, assertion }`. The server resolves the caller from the credential's `accountId` + `userHandle`. Exactly one of `identifier` / `challengeId` must be present — the route returns 400 otherwise.

### Last-passkey guard

`deletePasskey` refuses when this would be the final passkey AND the account has zero unused recovery codes. Users must generate recovery codes (or add a second passkey) before we let them lock themselves out.
