# D1 Read Replication and the Sessions API

A D1 database has one **primary**, in one region, and every query goes to it
unless the request opts into a **session**. cire's primary is in Oceania, so a
guest opening an invite from London pays a round trip to Sydney *for each query
the request makes*. Read replication puts read-only copies in other regions;
the [Sessions API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/read-replication/)
is how a Worker actually uses them without giving up read-your-writes.

## The cost being paid

Measured 2026-08-31 from a Sydney client against the OC-primary `cire-db`, by
diffing a route that runs one extra `SELECT` against a route that runs none:

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Control (no D1 query) | 15.0 ms |
| One extra `SELECT` | 50.7 ms |
| **Cost of one query** | **35.7 ms** (p10 33.0, p90 39.3, n=25) |

That is the *near* case. The same query from Europe or North America pays the
transoceanic round trip on top, and a request that reads four tables pays it
four times. Folding queries together — the work in #849, #852 — cuts N. Sessions
cut the distance instead: the first query goes to the primary, and every later
query in the same session can be served by any replica caught up to the
bookmark the first one returned.

  subgraph "Without a session"
    E1[Worker in London] -->|query 1| P1[(Primary, Sydney)]
    E1 -->|query 2| P1
    E1 -->|query 3| P1
  end
  subgraph "With a session"
    E2[Worker in London] -->|query 1| P2[(Primary, Sydney)]
    E2 -->|query 2| R2[(Replica, London)]
    E2 -->|query 3| R2
  end
```

## How a session is threaded through the Worker

`D1Database.withSession(constraint)` returns a `D1DatabaseSession` exposing
`prepare`, `batch` and `getBookmark()` — and `prepare` + `batch` are *exactly*
the two methods Drizzle's D1 driver ever calls, so a session can stand in for a
database.

The problem is where to put it. `@cire/api` builds its whole Elysia app graph
**once per isolate** (`aot: false`, ~50 route factories closing over one Drizzle
handle), so a per-request handle cannot be threaded explicitly through the
routes. The seam is `cire/api/src/db/d1-session.ts`:

| Piece | Lifetime | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `createSessionRoutedClient(binding)` | One per isolate | A stable `{ prepare, batch }` the Drizzle handle is built over. Each call delegates to whichever session is current. |
| `withD1Session(session, body)` | One per request | Puts a session on an `AsyncLocalStorage` for the duration of `body`. |
| `runInD1Session(d1, body)` | One per request | Opens a fresh session and does the above. Called in `fetch`, wrapping the entire dispatch, and once around each of the six `scheduled` sweeps. |

`node:async_hooks` is available because the Worker sets `nodejs_compat`.

> [!important] Losing the context is safe; crossing it would not be
> With no session on the context the shim falls through to the raw binding —

> older bookmark. Every service query runs through `dbQuery` →
> `Effect.promise` → Effect's fiber scheduler, which batches work from all live

## The constraint: always `first-primary`

`withSession()` takes `"first-primary"` or `"first-unconstrained"`.

| Constraint | First query | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| `first-primary` | Primary | The request observes every write committed before it started. |
| `first-unconstrained` | Anywhere | One more round trip saved; the request may not see a write that has already committed. |

cire uses `first-primary` Worker-wide. `routes/invite.ts` deliberately serves a
`no-store`, edit-sensitive payload so an organiser's edit shows up when a guest
revalidates the invite — `first-unconstrained` would reintroduce exactly the
staleness that header exists to prevent. One constraint for the whole Worker
keeps that property from depending on which route a request happened to reach.

## Turning replication on

Adopting the Sessions API is **inert until the database has replicas**: with
none, a session behaves exactly as before. So the code ships first and the
switch is flipped afterwards, separately and reversibly.

There is no `wrangler` subcommand as of wrangler 4.x — it is the dashboard
(D1 → database → Settings → Read replication) or the REST API:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CF_ACCOUNT_ID/d1/database/$DB_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"read_replication":{"mode":"auto"}}'
```

`mode: "auto"` lets Cloudflare place and manage replicas; `"disabled"` turns it
back off. Replicas are read-only and asynchronous — a write always goes to the
primary, and replication lag is what the bookmark protects a session from.

> [!note] Cost
> Cloudflare's docs are explicit that you "incur the exact same D1 usage billing
> with or without replicas, based on `rows_read` and `rows_written`" — so
> replication changes latency, not the row-count ceilings in
> [[free-tier-limits]]. What those docs do *not* state either way is whether the
> feature is available on the free plan; confirm that in the dashboard before
> counting on it.

## Rules

- **Never `first-unconstrained`.** See above. If a route ever genuinely wants
  it, it needs its own session and its own argument in writing, not a change to
  the Worker-wide constant.
- **One session per unit of work, established at the entry point.** One per
  request in `fetch`, one per sweep in `scheduled`. Not per route, not per
  service — a session opened deeper down starts its own bookmark chain and
  re-pays the first-query trip to the primary.
- **Anything that queries after the response is sent must be created inside the
  session scope.** `ctx.waitUntil(p)` only registers `p`; what matters is where
  `p` was created. Each `scheduled` sweep is wrapped for this reason — one
  session per sweep, not one shared by all six, so six unrelated delete-heavy
  sweeps do not keep advancing a single bookmark that then forwards every read
  to the primary anyway.
- **Build the Drizzle handle over the shim, never over `env.DB` directly** —
  a handle over the raw binding silently opts every query it serves out of
  replication, with no error to notice.

## History

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-31 | Measured the per-query cost from Sydney: 35.7 ms against the OC primary. |
| 2026-09-01 | `@cire/api` adopts the Sessions API — `db/d1-session.ts`, one session per `fetch` and per `scheduled` sweep, `first-primary`. Ships inert. |
