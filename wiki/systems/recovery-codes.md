# Recovery Codes

Copenhagen Book **M2** — single-use, high-entropy, account-scoped recovery tokens. They're the escape hatch when a user loses every device enrolled with a passkey. Landing this unblocks the next phase ([[identity-model]] — passkey-primary login).

## Shape

- Each code: 16 lowercase hex chars, displayed as `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`.
- Entropy: 64 bits per code (uniformly random via `crypto.randomBytes`).
- Batch size: **10 codes** per generation (`RECOVERY_CODE_COUNT`).
- Storage: only `SHA-256(normalised code)` lives in the DB. Raw codes are returned **once** at generation time, never retrievable again.

Normalisation strips whitespace and ASCII separators before hashing, and lowercases — a user typing `ABCD-1234-5678-EF00` or `abcd 1234 5678 ef00` both match the same stored hash.

## Schema

```
recovery_codes
  id            text PK            "rec_" + 12 hex
  account_id    text FK → accounts.id
  code_hash     text UNIQUE        hex of SHA-256(normalised code)
  used_at       integer NULL       unix seconds; non-null = consumed
  created_at    integer            unix seconds
```

Migration: `osn/db/drizzle/0004_add_recovery_codes.sql`.

## API

```
POST /recovery/generate
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  Body: {}
  → 200 { codes: [ "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx", ... × 10 ] }
  Rate limited: 3/hour/IP (recoveryGenerate)
```

Regenerating atomically replaces any previous set — the transaction deletes the existing rows and inserts the new ones. The previous codes become permanently invalid.

```
POST /login/recovery/complete
  Body: { identifier: "<handle-or-email>", code: "xxxx-..." }
  → 200 { session: TokenResponse, profile: PublicProfile }
  Rate limited: 5/hour/IP (recoveryComplete)
```

On success the server:
1. Marks the consumed row's `used_at` — the row is kept for audit.
2. **Revokes every session on the account** in the same transaction. The fresh session issued by the login step is the only one standing afterwards.
3. Sets the HttpOnly session cookie (C3) and returns the access token in the body.

All failure modes — unknown identifier, bad code, used code — surface as `{ error: "invalid_request" }` with no distinguishing detail, preserving the no-enumeration posture from `/login/otp`.

## Service layer

`createAuthService` exposes:

- `generateRecoveryCodesForAccount(accountId) → { codes: string[] }` — transactional replace + insert.
- `consumeRecoveryCode(identifier, code) → { profile }` — verify, mark used, revoke sessions, return profile.
- `completeRecoveryLogin(identifier, code) → { session, profile }` — `consumeRecoveryCode` + `issueTokens`, wrapped with the standard `withAuthLogin("recovery_code")` metric span.
- `countActiveRecoveryCodes(accountId)` — helpers for a "codes remaining" UI badge.

## Client

`createRecoveryClient({ issuerUrl })` in `@osn/client`:

```ts
await client.generateRecoveryCodes({ accessToken });  // → { codes }
await client.loginWithRecoveryCode({ identifier, code });  // → { session, profile }
```

UI: `RecoveryCodesView` (settings panel, show-once with copy + download) and `RecoveryLoginForm` (sign-in recovery modal).

## Observability

| Metric | Attrs | Emitted |
|---|---|---|
| `osn.auth.recovery.codes_generated` | none | Every successful generate |
| `osn.auth.recovery.code_consumed` | `result: success \| invalid \| used` | Every consume attempt |
| `osn.auth.recovery.duration` | `step: generate \| consume, result: ok \| error` | Histogram, per step |
| `osn.auth.login.*` | `method: recovery_code` | Inherited from the normal login wrapper on `completeRecoveryLogin` |

Spans: `auth.recovery.generate`, `auth.recovery.consume`, `auth.login.recovery_code`.

Redaction deny-list adds `recoveryCode`, `recovery_code`, `recoveryCodes`, `recovery_codes`, `codeHash`, `code_hash` — see `shared/observability/src/logger/redact.ts`.

## Threat model

- **Target risk:** an adversary with a leaked DB tries to brute-force a user's code. Per-user search space is 10 codes × 2^64 / 2^64 ≈ 2^64 operations on average to hit any code — infeasible. SHA-256 is fine: the tokens are uniformly random high-entropy secrets, not password-derived.
- **Online brute force** against one account is bounded by the IP rate limit (5/hr) + the 10-code × 2^64 search space. Effectively zero.
- **Leaked code at rest** (screenshot, shared notes): single-use, and regenerating invalidates it. The user's footgun surface is "I saved them badly"; the UI requires an explicit "I've saved these" checkbox before it will dismiss the one-time view.
- **No enumeration oracle** — every failure returns the same payload.

## When to regenerate

- After consuming one: the remaining 9 are still valid; no forced regen, but the UI should nudge at ≤3 active.
- After adding or removing a passkey: no-op (the codes are orthogonal to passkeys).
- Whenever the user suspects the codes leaked.
