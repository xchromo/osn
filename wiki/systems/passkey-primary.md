# Passkey-Primary Login

OSN accepts exactly one primary login factor: a WebAuthn credential — either a
platform passkey (Face ID / Touch ID / Windows Hello / Android screen lock)
or a roaming security key (FIDO2 Yubikey etc.). We removed OTP and magic-link
primary login; OTP survives as the step-up and email-change verification
factor.

## Account-level invariant

**Every live account has ≥1 WebAuthn credential at all times.** The invariant
holds from registration to deletion:

- **Registration.** `/register/complete` returns a session, but the UI
  refuses to dismiss the registration flow until `/passkey/register/complete`
  succeeds. There is no "skip for now" button.
- **Deletion.** `deletePasskey` refuses unconditionally if the delete would
  drop the account below 1 passkey (`osn/api/src/services/auth/passkey-management.ts`). Recovery
  codes are NOT a substitute credential — they are the "my device is gone"
  escape hatch only.
- **Rotation.** Users who want to remove a compromised passkey enrol the
  replacement first via Settings → Security → "Add passkey", then delete
  the old one. The add-passkey flow is step-up gated (passkey or OTP AMR)
  so a stolen access token can't silently bind a new authenticator — see
  "Step-up gating on register" below.

## Login surface

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /login/passkey/begin` | — | Issue WebAuthn options. Identifier-bound or identifier-less (discoverable). |
| `POST /login/passkey/complete` | — | Verify the assertion and issue a session. |
| `POST /login/recovery/complete` | — | Exchange identifier + recovery code for a session. Escape hatch. |

Client SDK surface (`@osn/client`):

- `LoginClient.passkeyBegin` / `passkeyComplete` — the only primary methods.
- `RecoveryClient.loginWithRecoveryCode` — the escape hatch.

UI surface (`@osn/ui/auth`):

- `<SignIn>` — WebAuthn-only. Renders a "Lost your passkey?" link that routes
  to `<RecoveryLoginForm>`. Feature-detects `browserSupportsWebAuthn()`; when
  false, shows a "passkey or security key required" screen that still lets
  the user enter a recovery code.
- `<Register>` — WebAuthn-gated. The flow stops at the start if the
  environment lacks WebAuthn support, and completion stays blocked until
  first-credential enrolment succeeds.
- `<PasskeysView>` (`@osn/ui/auth/PasskeysView`) — Settings → Security
  surface. Lists the account's credentials; supports rename (step-up
  gated, S-M2), delete (last-passkey guarded), and **Add passkey** (step-up
  gated via the same `/passkey/register/*` endpoints the registration
  flow uses). `@osn/social` mounts it behind a lazy-loaded
  `SecuritySection` so `@simplewebauthn/browser` only ships when the tab
  is opened. It also renders a collapsible **"Signing in somewhere new?"**
  help disclosure that points users at the three real ways onto a fresh
  device (backed-up/synced passkey, password-manager cross-device QR,
  recovery code) — see "New-device onboarding" below.
  - **`passkeyOnly` prop** — when set, the step-up dialog suppresses the OTP
    ("email me a code") factor and drives the passkey ceremony directly.
    Required wherever transactional email is degraded. The cire organiser
    portal sets it because its osn-api runs with `OSN_EMAIL_OPTIONAL=true`
    (Cloudflare email degraded), so an OTP step-up would wait on a code
    that never arrives. Every passkey-management gate accepts a passkey
    step-up (delete defaults to `webauthn`-only AMR; rename/register accept
    `webauthn`), so the flow stays fully functional without email.

### Surfaces that mount `<PasskeysView>`

| App | Mount point | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@osn/social` | lazy `SecuritySection` (Settings → Security) | OTP factor available. |
| `@cire/organiser` | `SecurityPanel.tsx`, reached via the top-level **Security** nav item (`#security`) in `OrganiserApp` | `passkeyOnly` forced on (degraded email). Wires the WebAuthn ceremonies with `@simplewebauthn/browser`; reads `accessToken` + `activeProfileId` from `useAuth()`. |

## New-device onboarding

Getting onto a brand-new device that holds no passkey yet does **not** use a
custom OSN flow — it reuses what already exists, surfaced as UI copy in the
`<PasskeysView>` help disclosure and the WebAuthn-unsupported `<SignIn>`
screen:

1. **Backed-up / synced passkey** — platform passkeys saved to iCloud
   Keychain, Google Password Manager, or a third-party password manager are
   already present on the user's other signed-in devices. No transfer needed.
2. **Cross-device sign-in (CaBLE / hybrid)** — on the sign-in screen the user
   picks the QR / nearby-device option their password manager offers and
   approves it from their phone. The osn-api cross-device endpoints
   (`/login/cross-device/*`, see `[[sessions]]`) exist for a future
   first-party QR transfer, but the password-manager hybrid flow covers the
   common case today with no extra client code.
3. **Recovery code** — if every passkey is lost, the user signs in via the
   "Lost your passkey?" recovery-code path, then enrols a fresh passkey from
   the authenticated Security panel.

## Accepting security keys

`generateRegistrationOptions` uses `residentKey: "preferred"` +
`userVerification: "required"`:

- Modern platform passkeys register as discoverable credentials with UV
  (the Copenhagen Book path).
- FIDO2 security keys with PIN/biometric register as non-discoverable — they
  work for identified login but not for the identifier-less flow.
- Obsolete UP-only U2F tokens **cannot register** — intentional (S-H2). They
  would fail at verification time anyway because `verifyAuthenticationResponse`
  sets `requireUserVerification: true`; admitting them at registration and
  rejecting at login would only produce broken accounts.

Both login options (identified and identifier-less) use `userVerification:
"required"` so options and verifier agree. The ceremony is phishing-resistant
with a second factor (UV = PIN, biometric, or device unlock).

## Step-up gating on register (S-H1)

`/passkey/register/begin` requires a fresh step-up token (`X-Step-Up-Token`
header or `step_up_token` body field; webauthn or otp AMR) when the account
already has ≥1 passkey. First-passkey enrolment (bootstrap) bypasses the
gate because no step-up ceremony is reachable before the account has any
credentials. This closes the "stolen access token → silent authenticator
binding" vector that the enrollmentToken deletion otherwise opened.

`/passkey/register/complete` additionally:
- Inserts a `security_events{kind: "passkey_register"}` row in the same
  transaction as the passkey insert — the user sees the new-credential
  banner even if an attacker skips the email client.
- Fires a best-effort `notifyPasskeyRegisteredByAccountId` via `forkDaemon`
  with a 10-second timeout. The body never includes identifying material.
- Derives the caller's session token from the HttpOnly cookie — H1
  invalidation of every other session cannot be silently skipped by a
  malicious caller omitting a body field.

## WebAuthn-unsupported environments

`browserSupportsWebAuthn()` is checked on mount in both `SignIn.tsx` and
`Register.tsx`. When false:

- **Register** — shows an informational screen, blocks the flow.
  Registration on a WebAuthn-incapable device would produce an account with
  no credentials and is never allowed.
- **SignIn** — shows an informational screen with these escape paths:
  - Sign in on a WebAuthn-capable device.
  - Use the password-manager cross-device / QR (CaBLE / hybrid) flow.
  - Plug in a FIDO2 security key and reload.
  - Use a recovery code.

## Recovery flow

Unchanged contract: `POST /login/recovery/complete` returns a session
directly. The user can immediately add a new passkey from the authenticated
state. This is the one place the account-level invariant relaxes. A user who
deleted their old passkey on another device before the recovery would hold
an account backed by recovery codes alone. Because `deletePasskey` refuses
to leave 0 passkeys, that state is unreachable in normal operation.

## Enumeration safety (S-M1)

`/login/passkey/begin` returns a uniform `200 { options: { allowCredentials,
userVerification, … } }` in all three branches:

- Unknown identifier: synthetic `allowCredentials` of length 1 (random 32
  bytes, base64url). No challenge is persisted, so a subsequent
  `/login/passkey/complete` hits the "challenge not found" guard,
  indistinguishable from a legitimate timeout.
- Known account with 0 passkeys (unreachable in practice — the ≥1 invariant
  holds — legacy/corrupt data only): same synthetic shape.
- Known account with ≥1 passkey: real `allowCredentials` from the DB.

An anonymous caller cannot probe the handle/email namespace through this
endpoint. A DB SELECT runs on both branches (real query for known; a
never-matching accountId query for unknown) so the latency distribution is
the same.

## Access-token audience (S-M2)

Access tokens carry `aud: "osn-access"`; `verifyAccessToken` asserts it.
This prevents any future token type minted with the same ES256 key from
authenticating access-token routes by accident.

## What was removed

- **Routes**: `POST /login/otp/{begin,complete}`, `POST /login/magic/{begin,verify}`.
- **Service methods**: `beginOtp`, `completeOtpDirect`, `beginMagic`,
  `verifyMagicDirect`, `issueEnrollmentToken`, `verifyEnrollmentToken`.
- **In-memory state**: `otpStore`, `magicStore`, `consumedEnrollmentTokens`.
- **Config fields**: `magicLinkBaseUrl`, `magicTtl`.
- **Client SDK methods**: `LoginClient.otpBegin/otpComplete/magicBegin/magicVerify`;
  `CompleteRegistrationResult.enrollmentToken`; `passkeyRegisterBegin/Complete`
  now take `accessToken` instead of `enrollmentToken`.
- **UI components**: `@osn/ui/auth/MagicLinkHandler` (deleted).
- **Rate-limiter slots**: `otpBegin`, `otpComplete`, `magicBegin`.
- **Metrics**: `osn.auth.magic_link.sent`; `AuthMethod` union narrowed to
  `"passkey" | "recovery_code" | "refresh"`; `AuthRateLimitedEndpoint`
  dropped `otp_begin`, `otp_complete`, `magic_begin`.
- **Body input**: `POST /passkey/register/complete` no longer accepts
  `session_token` in the body; the server derives it from the HttpOnly
  cookie (S-H1).
